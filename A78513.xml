            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Believe thou art not ignorant of the many diſſenſions &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions that have been among the People of God about the Sabbath-day. Some ſtood for the old Sabbath (ſo called by ſome) meaning the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath-day. Some for a new Sabbath (ſo called by ſome) meaning the day of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And ſome for no Sabbath but what Magiſtrates do appoint. No ſmall Controverſies have been between all theſe about the Sabbath-day, as I believe thou knoweſt. But the ground and cauſe of all ſuch their Controverſies; and how for Peace and Agreement ſake it may be removed and taken away, I ſuppoſe thou doſt not know: both which I will diſcover unto thee.</p>
            <p>The ground of ſuch their differences is a miſunderſtanding of theſe words of the Commandment, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and do all thy work, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt do no manner of work.</hi> By the ſix days muſt be meant, either the ſix days of Gods work, or the ſix days of work with men: either the ſix firſt days at the Creation, in which God wrought, and made all things; or elſe the ſix work-days of the week in uſe with men where they live. So alſo the ſeventh day muſt relate to the ſix days of Gods work, or elſe to the ſix days of mens labour: it muſt be the ſeventh day from the beginning of the Creation, or the ſeventh day from mens beginning their ſix week-days of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; It muſt either be the day of Gods Reſt, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed the ſix days of his work, or the day of reſt
<pb facs="tcp:152822:3"/> with men, which immediately follows their ſix days of work where they live.</p>
            <p>They, between whom the ſaid diſſenſions have been and are, have and do hold generally, that the ſeventh day muſt and doth relate to the ſix days of Gods labour, and not of mans: It muſt be, they all think, the very day of Gods Reſt, the ſeventh day from the Creation. Thus they all thought that the <hi>Jews</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, which was from Fridays Sun-ſetting to Saturdays Sun-ſetting, was the preciſe day of Gods Reſt: and every of their other ſix days of the week, to be the very ſame with the ſix days of the Creation, whether they lived in <hi>Judea,</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Ophyr,</hi> or in any other place, it maketh no matter, think they. Though Sunday with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be the day immediately following their ſix days of labour; and on which they having laboured ſix days, do then reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour according unto Gods example; Yet at no hand will they yield Sunday to be the ſeventh day and Sabbath of the Lord: Sunday they hold to be the firſt day of the week, and the very ſame with the firſt day of the Creation with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they live. From this common errour ſprouted out vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions, which ſet them all at Variance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſuch as adhere to their ſuperſtition, do &amp; will ſtill plead for the Saturday-Sabbath: the Saturday they believe to be the day of Gods Reſt, the day he Bleſſed and Sanctified: they cannot conceit well of a new Sabbath, they know not whence it is. Though an Angel ſhould come from Heaven and tell them, that Chriſt the Son of God came into the World, and hath taken away their Sabbath and hath eſtabliſhed another contrary to what God the Father Inſtituted; So that whereas before they had the ſeventh day for a day of reſt, Chriſt Inſtituted that ſeventh day to be a work day: That whereas God the Father Bleſſed and Sanctified the ſeventh day, Chriſt took off the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leſſing from it, and gave it to the firſt day: That whereas God the Father appointed his People to work before they did reſt, Chriſt appointed them to reſt before they did work: That whereas before they were to work, and do all
<pb facs="tcp:152822:3"/> that they had to do in ſix days, and reſt on the ſeventh day, according to Gods example; Now they muſt reſt on the firſt day, and work the ſix days after, which is contrary to Gods example. I ſay, if an Angel from Heaven ſhould come and teach them thus, they would not believe him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some there be, and they not a few, Godly, Precious, and tender-hearted <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> who knowing that the Church of God hath ever ſince our Saviours Aſcenſion obſerved the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day for their Sabbath, and that not againſt, but with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, do ſlight the Seventh-day Sabbath, and are tooth and nail for the firſt day of the week (ſo they count Sunday to be, neither can they count it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as long as they hold the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath to be the ſeventh day from the Creation) believing that the Apoſtles of Chriſt by the appointment of our Saviour, changed the old Sabbath (ſo they call the Seventh-day Sabbath,) to the Sabbath of the firſt day of the week; ſo that now the Church of God is to reſt before they labour, and unto, not from their labour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some again, knowing that the <hi>Jews</hi> Saturday Sabbath was Ceremonial and abrogated, do thence hold and maintain the Seventh day Sabbath to be abrogated alſo; and for that they know not any other Sabbath day appointed by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority inſtead thereof, do inferr, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now in time of the Goſpel are to have and keep no Sabbath-day at all.</p>
            <p>Thus kind Reader, I have ſhewed thee the ground and cauſe of theſe various and different Opinions about the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day. Whence have iſſued moſt, if not all the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which are now on foot between them.</p>
            <p>The only mean to ſtop all future Controverſies, and bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g all ſides to accord in one truth about the Sabbath day, is to take away, and wipe off from their minds the aforeſaid errour, which occaſioned all their differences. For as long as they or any ſide of them hold, that the ſeventh day which God Bleſſed and Sanctified, and commanded to be obſerved by all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, doth relate to the ſix days of Gods work, and not of mans; that is, as long as they hold the ſeventh day here commanded to
<pb facs="tcp:152822:4"/> be the very day of Gods Reſt, the ſeventh day from the firſt beginning of the Creation, they will never come to agree in the Truth, but more and more differences will ſtill riſe. Whereas if they all conſent in the true underſtanding of the aforeſaid words of the Commandment, that the ſeventh day relateth to the ſix days of work with men, and ſo muſt be the day after the ſix week-days of labour with People wherever they dwell; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement then of all ſides will be had. That great ſtumbling-block given the <hi>Jews</hi> of our not keeping the ſeventh day, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Precept and Example, which doth ſo ſtave them off from affecting our Religion, will be wholly taken away; they cannot then but acknowledge that we keep the ſeventh day of the week, the day following our ſix days of labour, the very Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day pointed out unto us here in this Law. They alſo who now ſtand for a new Sabbath-day, who ſay the Sabbath-day is changed, and the firſt day of the week to have been Inſtituted inſtead of the ſeventh, will have no ground for ſuch their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And laſtly, they who ſay the Church of Chriſt never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Sabbath ſince Chriſts Aſcenſion, and would from the practice of the Apoſtles, and the Church of Chriſt argue the Abrogation of the ſeventh-day-Sabbath, will quickly be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, and acknowledge, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved that day for their Sabbath, which in this Law was commanded by the Lord God, ſo <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo have ever done; They have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame day, the laſt day of the week, the day following their ſix days of labour according to Gods example.</p>
            <p>But Courteous Reader, haply thou doubteſt here, and would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be ſatisfied, that whereas God commandeth by this Law all his Obedient Children to keep the ſeventh day of the week, which is the Sabbath day holy unto his Honour: If the <hi>Jews</hi> then keep the Sabbath-day on the ſeventh day of the week, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods command; How can <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who keep their Sabbath a whole day after, be ſaid to keep their Sabbath on the ſeventh day of the week too, according to Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>For thy ſatisfaction herein, let me now ask thee one Queſtion
<pb facs="tcp:152822:4"/> like unto thine? thine anſwer to mine will ſatisfie thine own.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Pope made a Decree that all his obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould keep the 25. day of <hi>December,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> holy to the honour of Chriſt: If the <hi>French</hi> then keep <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> on the 25th. of <hi>December,</hi> according to the Popes decree; How can the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, who kept their <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> full ten days after, be ſaid to keep their <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> on the 25th. day of <hi>December</hi> too, according to the Popes Decree?</p>
            <p>Thou wilt anſwer me, that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, did all of them keep their <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> on the ſame day of the month, on the 25th. day of <hi>December</hi> according to the Popes Decree: and that the reaſon why the 25th day of <hi>December</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> came to be ten days ſooner than with the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> was for that they began their months ſooner by ten days than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did, ever ſince Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> altered their year. The like anſwer I give thee: the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> all of them keep their Sabbath on the ſame day of the week, on the ſeventh day of the week; and that the reaſon why the ſeventh day of the week with the <hi>Jews,</hi> came to be a day ſooner then it did with <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> was becauſe they began their week a day ſooner than they did before, and ſooner than the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now do, and that did they ever ſince the Lord cauſed them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to alter their year and their months, as I have ſhewed, in the third and tenth Chapters more fully.</p>
            <p>So that if we could agree in the true underſtanding of the aforeſaid words of the Commandment; that by the ſeventh day is not meant the day following Gods ſix days of work, but the day following mens ſix days of labour, all our controverſies about the Sabbath-day will ſoon end.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to clear, and make apparent unto all men, that this is the true meaning and that the ſaid words of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment are ſo to be underſtood, I have in this enſuing Tract,</p>
            <p>Firſt, diſcover'd that old, and rotten root from whence this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of holding the day of Gods Reſt to be the ſame with the <hi>Jews</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:152822:5"/> Sabbath, where-ever they lived, had its firſt ſpring: and that was from a meer ſuppoſal of the Earths ſuperficies to be plain as a Champion field, as is ſhewed fully in the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> Indeed if the Earth be pla n, every day muſt be the ſame day with all People. Every of the ſix days at the Creation muſt be every where the ſame day of the week, and ſo the ſeventh day from the firſt beginning of the Creation, the day of Gods Reſt, muſt be the ſeventh day of the week with the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in all other places: the which cannot be if the Earth be round, as thou mayeſt ſee more at large in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the days of the week begin ſooner in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than in other; Then ſo may the day of Gods reſt alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> One and the ſame week-day doth not begin ſooner in ſome places than in other. The day which men call Sunday at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> begins ſooner than the day we call Sunday here: But they be not both one and the ſame day. One and the ſame day is for one and the ſame place only. If one and the ſame day ſhould begin ſooner in ſome places than in other, then it muſt needs be that either it muſt begin in ſome one place or other firſt before it began in any place elſe, either Eaſt or Weſt thereto; or elſe that it was infinite without any firſt beginning at all. Either of which no underſtanding man will affirm; much leſs that the day of Gods Reſt begins ſooner in one place than in another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have proved ſufficiently that the day of Gods Reſt could not be the ſame with the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath-day, nor the ſame kind of day; and that all, and every of the days of the Creation were far different from week-days that were in uſe with the <hi>Jews,</hi> or are, or at any time have been in uſe with men. To this purpoſe I have ſhewed what kind of days our week days be; and what the <hi>Jews</hi> week-days be; and what the days of the Creation were: and how they all differ in kind from each other, in <hi>Chap,</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And then what kind of day the Sabbath-day muſt be in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152822:5"/>
            <p>Thirdly, I have ſhew'd, what day the Sabbath-day is to be in reſpect of order and tale. That it is to be the <hi>ſeventh day:</hi> Not the ſeventh day from the firſt beginning of the Creation, nor the ſeventh day from any ſet <hi>Era, or Epoche,</hi> but the ſeventh day from the time we begin the week for labour where we live, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. Concerning which I have ſhewed, why the Lord ſet the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> a time when they, after they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> muſt begin their week; whereby in count of their week-days, and ſo alſo of their ſeventh Sacred day, they differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all other Nations, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8, 9, 10. and what weeks be; and the difference between a week, and the week: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſeventh day of the week, and the ſeventh day of the week; which laſt is the Lords day, or Sabbath of the Lord, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11, 12. And alſo the Antiquity of weeks, and the anſwer unto the main Objection thereto in <hi>Chapters</hi> 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I have ſhewed that Sunday was of Old the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the week with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and moſt probably was the ſeventh day of the week alſo with the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood; and hath continued with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> their ſeventh day of the week even unto this preſent day; and doubtleſs ever will to the Worlds end, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, my hearty deſire is that thou, and all other the Obedient Servants of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be rightly informed concerning our obſervation of the Sabbath-day. Haply thou didſt before the reading hereof hold, that <hi>this fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a branch of the Moral Law; that it is agreeable to the Law of nature to have a day in ſeven to be for Gods Worſhip; that Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is our Chriſtian Sabbath; as Saturday was the Jews Sabbath; and that as God wrought ſix days, and reſted the ſeventh, and Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſeventh day unto Holineſs and Reſt, even ſo all Gods Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent People ſhould not be ſlothful, but diligent in their callings on the ſix work-days, and reſt on the Sunday according to Gods example, and
<pb facs="tcp:152822:6"/> keep it Holy.</hi> If this was thine Opinion, thou wert in the right, and didſt hold nothing in all theſe but what Godly and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and the Servants of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did generally teach in former time the People of God here in <hi>England,</hi> as may plainly appear to thee, if thou readeſt only that Homily, which is for the <hi>time and place of Gods Worſhip.</hi> But ſince that, ſubtile heads have been imployed to the ſubverting hereof, and bringing in a dangerous errour, opening a flood-gate to all licentiouſneſs on the Lords Sabbath, they have publickly Taught and Publiſhed to the World, that <hi>the ſeventh day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bept holy, is none other but the day of Gods reſt.</hi> They would bring People in hand, that the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath was the very ſeventh day from the Creation, and none other but that to be the ſeventh day of the week with any People; and ſo Sunday to be with us the firſt day of the week. To this end (I ſuppoſe) they would have the name of our Sabbath-day, which the <hi>Jews</hi> called in their Tongue, <hi>The firſt day of the Sabbath,</hi> to be Tranſlated (as it is in our Bibles) not <hi>The Lords day,</hi> or <hi>Sunday,</hi> by which names <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (whoſe Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were <hi>Gentiles,</hi>) ever called it, but <hi>The firſt day of the week;</hi> that ſo People may conceive hereby (though a new name doth not alter the nature of the thing) that Sunday with us is not in order <hi>the ſeventh day of the week,</hi> viz. <hi>the day following the ſix days of labour, but the day going before the ſix days of labour with us,</hi> and therefore not the Sabbath-day here commanded; for the rooting out of which errour, and confirming all in the Truth concerning the Lords day, I have ſent abroad this little Tract. If now by thy ſerious peruſal hereof thou art the more encouraged to render the Lord his due Honour in the heedful obſervation of the Lords day, which with us is Sunday, not for cuſtoms ſake, becauſe thy fore-fathers and the Church of God ever obſerved the ſame ſince theti me of the Apoſtles: nor for that the Magiſtrates have commanded us to keep this day Holy: Nor for that the ſeventh-day-Sabbath
<pb facs="tcp:152822:6"/> is aboliſhed, and this to be a new Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted: but for that God in this his Law which is perpetual and unalterable, hath commanded thee and all People, expreſly to keep holy the ſeventh day; give God the glory, and lift up a Prayer unto him for me a poor ſinner.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Univerſal day. The days of the Creation. Why <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet the Evening before the Morning.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE Univerſal day</hi> is, that which is one, and the ſame day in all places through the whole Univerſe; as well in reſpect of its beginning, as of its duration and ending. It is not one day at one part of the Earth, and another day at another part; but when it beginneth or endeth any where, it beginneth or endeth every where at the ſame time.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:152822:9"/>
               <p>This kind of Day cannot properly be ſaid to begin either in the Eaſt, or in the VVeſt, or at Sun-riſing, or at Sun-ſetting, or at Mid-night, or at Noon, as other kind of days do. For there is neither Eaſt nor VVeſt, nor Sun-riſing nor Sun-ſetting; or at Midnight nor Noon in reſpect of the VVorld; though in reſpect of the parts of the World, all and every of theſe may be ſaid to be; yet ſo as what is Eaſt or morning to one part, is Weſt or Sun-ſetting to another part; and midnight to one part is mid-day to another part; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them properly can be ſo ſaid to be the whole World. Such kind of days were thoſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis, Gen.</hi> 1.5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31. And of which mention is made in this text and elſewhere, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. <hi>and</hi> 31.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>and</hi> 3.7, 10. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.31. <hi>In ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, &amp;c. and reſted the ſeventh day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That theſe days (which ſome do term, and fitly enough may be called, <hi>The days of the Creation</hi>) were ſuch Univerſal days, I will endeavour to clear, by giving inſtances in every of them which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of, in rehearſing the Works of the Creation.</p>
               <p>The firſt of thoſe ſeven days was ſuch an Univerſal day, when it began any where, it began every where; no where then was it no day, nor any other than the firſt day.</p>
               <p>The firſt things God made were day and night: or light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They were neither of them in time before the other, but were both Coëtaneous.</p>
               <p>There was in nature before, though not in time, a mixed or confuſed dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which <hi>Moſes</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. which <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> correcting <hi>Pagnin,</hi> tranſlateth and calleth it <hi>Caligo;</hi> it was neither perfect day nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect night.</p>
               <p>But when God had thence formed the light, and made it to ſhine out of the darkneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. and had divided the light from the darkneſs, ſo as that they ſhould never be both in one Hemiſphere, but ſucceed in order each other, which is called Gods Covenant of the day, and of the night, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.20. God then called that light ſo divided Day, and that darkneſs ſo divided, called by <hi>Moſes</hi> Emphatically <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God called night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.4, 5. the full Revolution of both which was the firſt day; in this diviſion of the light and darkneſs, or day and night, though the night was before the day in one Hemiſphere, and the day before the night in the other; yet in reſpect of the whole Univerſe, neither of them was before the other in time. When the firſt day began ſomewhere, when it was night at the ſame time that firſt day began ſome otherwhere, when it was day-light; every where did the firſt day begin at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day and the third day in like manner were Univerſal days. When God ſtretched out the firmament on the ſecond day, it was every where then the ſecond day. On the next day alſo, whereſoever God the Univerſal Worker did his work, throughout the whole round, in gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152822:10"/> the Waters, making the Seas and dry Land, there every where was it the third day. And after that every where was it the ſame third day, where God made the Earth to bring forth Graſs, and Herbs, and fruit-trees, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. no where was it then either the ſecond or fourth day.</p>
               <p>The fourth day in which the Sun, Moon and Stars were made, was an Univerſal day. When it was the fourth day any where, it was the fourth every where. It is not revealed in what part of the fourth day thoſe lights of Heaven were made; but moſt certain is it, that when the Sun firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World on that day, it was over ſome part of the Earth at that time, making it to be noon there, and in all places in that Hemiſphere, which were in the ſame Meridian with the Sun. And that in many places ninety degrees Eaſt from thence <hi>it was Sun-ſetting;</hi> and in as many places ninety degrees Weſt from thence, it was then at the ſame time <hi>Sun-riſing.</hi> Alſo that in the other Hemiſphere to which the Moon or Stars appeared, it was then night, and mid-night there in thoſe places that were in the ſame Meridian with the Sun. So that although on that fourth day Sun-ſetting was before Sun-riſing in ſome places, and Sun-riſing before Sun-ſetting in ſome other places; and in ſome places noon was before either of the other; and in ſome other places mid-night was before them all; yet in reſpect of the whole Earth, not one of them was on that fourth day before the other: But at the Suns firſt appearing, and ſhining over half the Earth, it was at that very inſtant the fourth day, as well where it was Sun ſetting, or Sun-riſing, as where it was noon: and likewiſe it was then the fourth day alſo in the other part of the Earth to which the Moon, or Stars firſt appeared; For neither the Sun, Moon or Stars appeared to any place on the third day, which was the day before they were made, and the fifth day was not then begun.</p>
               <p>The like I ſay for the fifth day, and for the ſixth day; when God made Fiſh and Foul on the fifth day; or when he made <hi>Adam</hi> the laſt of his Creatures on the ſixth day, it was then after Sun-ſetting in ſome places, and before Sun-riſing in ſome other places; and it was then noon in ſome places, and mid-night in ſome other places, yet all on the ſame day.</p>
               <p>The like I ſay alſo for the ſeventh day: the day of Gods reſt: When God reſted from all his Works that he had made, it was no where then the ſixth day, but every where the ſeventh day. The day of Gods reſt began in ſome places at Sun-riſing, in ſome places at Sun-ſetting, and in ſome at noon, and in other ſome at mid-night in the ſame day. For ſo was it on the fourth day when the Sun firſt appeared, and ſo when it was half ended; and ſo likewiſe when it was fully ended; and therefore ſo was it when the fifth, ſixth or ſeventh day began, or ended. It is not revealed, and therefore no man can know, what, or where in the Earth thoſe places are where it was Sun-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or Sun-ſetting, or noon, or mid-night, either when the Sun firſt ſhined forth to the World, or when half of that fourth day was ended, or when it was fully ended; and therefore no man can tell, nor poſſibly can any find out, whether here in <hi>England</hi> (or in any other particular place or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152822:10"/> it was Sun-ſetting or Sun-riſing, noon or mid-night, day-light or night, when the fifth, ſixth, or ſeventh day, the day of Gods Reſt began, and yet at the beginning of that ſeventh day, it was either of theſe ſomewhere or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay, why then did <hi>Moſes,</hi> rehearſing every of the ſix days Works of the Creation, ſet the evening before the morning, ſo if the evening was not before the morning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer <hi>Moſes</hi> naming the evening in order before the morning in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis, Gen.</hi> 1.5.8, 13, 19, 23, 31. doth not thereby make either of them to be in time before the other; one he was to name firſt; and the reaſons why he named the evening before the morning, may be theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For that after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (and I ſuppoſe this Hiſtory to be written after that) their Year, their Months, and the days of their Week were all changed in reſpect of their beginnings and endings; ſo that whereas they began their days with the morning; thenceforth they conſtantly began their Week-days with the evening; <hi>See chap.</hi> 3. as I ſhall ſhew more at large in the next Chapter. If <hi>Moſes</hi> now ſhould have ſet the morning before the evening, he might have ſeemed to diſlike this their new cuſtom of beginning their days of the Week with the evening, for which he had direction from the Lord God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Or elſe it may be for that they, (who were beſt skill'd in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and diſtinguiſhing of time, as were <hi>Aſtronomers;</hi> ſuch as doubtleſs <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was, <hi>who was Learned in all the Wiſdom of the Egyptians,) Acts</hi> 7.22. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the day at noon, making the evening, that is, all the time from noon to midnight to be the former part of the day; and the evening, that is all the time from mid-night to noon to be the latter part; as I will more fully ſhew in the fourth Chapter, <hi>See chap.</hi> 4.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Horizontal day. What the parts of the Horizontal day are: And which part is the former.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Horizontal day</hi> with any Nation, is that ſpace of time in which the Sun is in going from their <hi>Horizon</hi> at its riſing, until it cometh again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Horizon</hi> at its next riſing: or from their <hi>Horizon</hi> at its ſetting, until it come unto their <hi>Horizon</hi> again at its next ſetting; or more briefly thus.</p>
               <p>The Horizontal day is the time between Sun-riſing and Sun-riſing, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sun-ſetting and Sun-ſetting.</p>
               <p>The parts of the Horizontal day are two; the one is the Artificial day, or day-light, of which we may read in <hi>Geneſis, Gen.</hi> 1.5, 14, 16. <hi>and</hi> 8.22.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152822:11"/> 
                  <hi>and</hi> 31, 39. the other part is the night or darkneſs, called by<note n="(a)" place="margin">Clav. de Spho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e was divided with the <hi>Jews</hi> into three watches: the evening watch, the middle watch, and the morning watch; but after that when they were ſubdued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> they divided the night as the <hi>Romans</hi> did, into four watches.</p>
               <p>The Artificial day, or day-light was Antiently counted to be the former part of this day, and the night the latter part, and ſo not only before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but after their deliverance did they count this day ſo to begin in reſpect of their civil affairs, as may appear.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For that when the parts of this day were mentioned, the morning was ſet before the night, before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 1.16, 18. <hi>and</hi> 8.22. <hi>and</hi> 7.4.12.38, 39, 40. yea and commonly afterwards too, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.35. <hi>Ex.</hi> 13.21, 22. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.21. though they had the beginning of their days altered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe at what time ſoever of the day-light they ſpake of the night following they expreſſed the ſame thus, <hi>To night, this night the ſame night, Gen.</hi> 19.34. <hi>and</hi> 26.24. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.32. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.25. <hi>and</hi> 7.9. as belonging to the ſame day, and not to the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that. And whenever they at any time of the day-light, ſpake of the night paſt, they never uſed ſuch expreſſions, whereby it may ſeem to belong as a part of the day following, but contrariwiſe, ſhewing it to be a part of the day before-going; as yeſternight, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.42. <hi>and</hi> 19.33, 34. the night of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday. Alſo at night when they ſpake of the day following, they uſed not to ſay <hi>To day, or this day,</hi> as they did of the day before-going; but <hi>To morrow, or the morrow after, Numb.</hi> 33.3. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.11. and to morrow ſignifieth another day. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.34. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.13, 14.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the night was made the former part of the day, even from that night in which they had their deliverance. <hi>It was a night to be much obſerved unto the Lord, for bringing them out from the Land of</hi> Egypt. <hi>This is that night of the Lord, to be obſerved of all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in their generations, Exod.</hi> 12.42. They were commanded after that time, to Celebrate their Sabbath from <hi>Even</hi> to <hi>Even, Lev.</hi> 23.32. And therefore ſo did they begin their week-days alſo, whereby their Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was meaſured out to be unto them their ſeventh day; otherwiſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day would not have been proportionable to their ſix days of labour. Their year alſo had thenceforth a new beginning. They muſt not begin their year in <hi>Tiſri</hi> as they did before, but with that Month in which they had their freedom. <hi>This month ſhall be unto you the beginning of months. Exod.</hi> 12.2. This month called by the <hi>Hebrews Abib, Exod.</hi> 13.4. <hi>and</hi> 23.15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.1. and by the <hi>Chaldeans Niſan, Eſth.</hi> 4.7. (which conſiſted partly of our <hi>March,</hi> and partly of <hi>April,</hi> being with them the month after the Vernal Equinoctial,) was their firſt month thenceforth; ſo that whereas before they began their year after their Harveſt, and after all their in-gathering of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152822:11"/> fruits of the Earth was ended, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. <hi>and</hi> 34.22. which was partly in our <hi>September;</hi> after this they were to begin their year fartheſt off from that time. They had then a new-year, and a new month, and a new day, to begin the year withal. <hi>No otherwiſe than if the day of their deliverance had been their birth day; for their deliverance was a kind of a new birth unto them: The beginning of the year was then changed, for the greater luſtre unto the birth of the Church,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin. And the new time of the day had they to begin their firſt day of the year, (for their</hi> Caput anni, <hi>or New years-day was a ſacred day with them) they began it at even at the going down of the Sun, at the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they came forth out of the land of</hi> Egypt; <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.6. then was their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance made and Sealed up unto them in the Paſſover. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in reſpect of their Civil affairs they begun their year, their months &amp; their days as they did before, yet in this their New, Eccleſiaſtical, or Sacred year, or Computation of time, they began their day at <hi>Even.</hi> All their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-days, and all other their ſacred days, and ſo all their week days, for meaſuring out unto them their Sacred days began at the <hi>Even;</hi> they had the evening to be the former part of the day. And this may be one reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> in rehearſing the works of Creation, ſetteth the evening before the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as I ſaid before. <hi>See chap.</hi> 2.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Morning is all the time in which the Sun is in its riſing, until it come unto its greateſt height: that is, all the time between mid-night and noon is the Morning.</p>
               <p>And the Evening is all the time the Sun is in its deſcending, that is, all the time between noon and midnight.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſtians generally now do, and formerly have counted and called theſe parts of this day. If common ſervice unto God hath been done in Churches or Colledges, at any time in the forenoon, either at three, four, ſix, nine or eleven of the Clock, it was commonly called by the name of <hi>Mattius, Morning-Service,</hi> or <hi>Morning-Prayer,</hi> and if it had been done at any time in the afternoon, it was then commonly called <hi>Evening-Song, Evening-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152822:12"/> Evening-Service,</hi> or ſuch like, though it had been done by day-light, or by Candle-light. So alſo the People of God did in Antient times, divide the day into ſuch parts; one whereof they called the Morning, and the other the Evening, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.23. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.6. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.4. though an act was done before day, yet did they count it to be done in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.55. <hi>Laban</hi> roſe early in the night according to the Vulgar Tranſlation, which in ours is early in the morning. The like is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34.4. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> coming to the Sepulchre was before day, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the darkneſs or night yet in being, <hi>John</hi> 20.1. notwithſtanding that time was counted to be in the morning, and the time of our Saviours Reſurrection was before that, yet was it in the morning.</p>
               <p>This kind of day, that is, the Meridional day is, and ever hath been in common uſe with all Chriſtians, who do and have counted the day as their Heathen Anceſtors did before them: after mid-night reckoning one, two, three, (and ſo to twelve of the Clock) in the morning; and the like in the afternoon for the evening. So we at this time do begin the day from mid-night, making the morning to be the former part of the day; and the evening the latter part. So did the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were for dividing and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of time excellent; and ſo did the <hi>Romans,</hi> and accordingly ſo did Chriſtians begin the day from mid-night. <hi>Aegyptii &amp; Sacerdotes Romani à media nocte in alteram mediam noctem numerabant diem, qua conſuetudo adhuc in Eccleſia Romana permanſit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Clav. in Sphaerae Jo. de ſacro Boſ. ubi de officiis Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian.</note> In like manner did the <hi>Jews</hi> begin the day with them in their ordinary and common account of time, making the morning to be the former part of the day; though the <hi>Jews</hi> from their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> began all their ſacred days or Sabbaths from the time of the ſetting of the Sun, <hi>See chap.</hi> 3. and alſo the days ſerving to meet out to them their ſacred days, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.6, 7. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.5, 6. <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.18, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.4. all which were Sabbatical days, and called by the <hi>Jews, The firſt day of the Sabbath, the ſecond day of the Sabbath, &amp;c.</hi> for thus they called the days of their Week or Sabbath. Yet otherwiſe commonly and generally, they continued to count their day to begin with the morning as before. Never did they begin any day of their Month, but with the morning, making the evening to be the latter part of the day. As for inſtance, the day before their coming out of <hi>Rameſes,</hi> was the fourteenth day of <hi>Abib,</hi> Num. 33.3. <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.6.18. <hi>In that night,</hi> that is, in the night of that fourteenth day, <hi>they did eat the Paſſover,</hi> Exod. 12.8. <hi>and in that night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the morrow, they burned what of the Paſſover they eat not,</hi> Exod. 12.10. <hi>and not one after that till mid-night was paſt, and the morrow come, was to go out of the door of his houſe,</hi> Exod. 12.22. <hi>At mid-night all the firſt born in</hi> Egypt <hi>were ſlain,</hi> Exod. 2.29. <hi>But the next day,</hi> that is, after mid-night, <hi>Pharaoh and the</hi> Egyptians <hi>urged them while it was night, to riſe and haſte away.</hi> Inſomuch that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> took their dough before it was leavened, and ſo in haſte went from <hi>Rameſes. Exod.</hi> 12.30.31, 32, 33, 34, 37. Whence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152822:12"/> it is evident that the evening in which they ate the Paſſover, and were not to ſtir out of doors till the morning, was part of the fourteenth day, and that the time after mid-night, in which they were urged to haſte away, and in which they went abroad out of doors to provide their Cattle, to conſult about their Journey, and their going from <hi>Rameſes,</hi> was on the fifteenth day. <hi>They ate the Paſſover on the fourteenth, and took their journey on the fifteenth day,</hi> Numb. 33.3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The fleſh of the Peace-offering was to be eaten on the ſame day it was offered, and might not be eaten after the whole evening was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſt. The ſame may appear alſo if the offering had been a vow. <hi>Lev,</hi> 7.15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The day in which Jeſus Chriſt ate the Paſſover with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, was the fourteenth day of the month: on the ſame day Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples asked him, where they ſhould provide and prepare for him to eat the Paſſover, and on the ſame day <hi>Peter</hi> denyed his Maſter, and the Cock crew, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.30. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.34. I ſay, the Queſtion demanded of Chriſt by his Diſciples, the killing the Paſchal Lamb, the eating the Paſſover, <hi>Peters</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his Maſter, and the Cocks crowing, were all done on one and the ſame day of the month; though the eating the Paſſover, <hi>Peters</hi> denial, and the Cocks crowing, were done in the evening, in the latter part of that four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day.</p>
               <p>The Aſtronomers eſpecially, and ſome others in Antient times, began the Meridional day at noon. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Holifax</hi> telleth us, that the <hi>Arabians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their day at noon, and giveth this reaſon for it; <hi>Becauſe when the Sun was made and appeared to the World, it was then in a Meridian.</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Jo de ſacr. Boſc. in libello de Computo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtico.</note> In the day ſo beginning at noon, they had the ſame parts of the day, <hi>viz.</hi> morning and evening, only they made the evening to be the former part. And it is more probable than otherwiſe, that when the Sun was made, and firſt appeared to the World, it was then in the ſame Meridian that <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was of, making it then to be noon there: At that time doth the Sun ſhew it ſelf with the greateſt light, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>Job</hi> 11.17.5.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.10. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.9. luſtre ſtrength and glory: making it to be Sun-riſing, ninety degrees from it Weſt-ward; and Sun-ſetting, ninety degrees from it Eaſtward: and day-light in all places in either ſide. Now I ſee no reaſon, and I think no man can give any to the contrary, but that the Sun ſhould rather thus appear in its glory to <hi>Paradiſe</hi> firſt, than unto <hi>Spain, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, America,</hi> or to any other place whatſoever. And then if ſo, <hi>Moſes</hi> had good reaſon even from hence to ſet the evening before the morning. <hi>See ch.</hi> 2. And then it is likely that God made the living Creature after his kind, and <hi>Adam</hi> alſo in the afternoon, and that in the night following, (I mean when it was night in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> though it was then day in ſome other places,) the deep ſleep fell on <hi>Adam,</hi> when God made the Woman, and that ſhe was brought unto him in the morning. The naming of the Creatures may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152822:13"/> this, for ought we know to the contrary, yet all before the next evening, that is, before the next day, beginning at noon there.</p>
               <p>But if any will contend, that unleſs there be better proofs given than probabilities, we ſhould not conceive the days of the Creation, either the fourth, ſixth or ſeventh to begin in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> rather at noon than at mid-night, Sun-riſing, or at Sun-ſetting. Yet ſure it is more than probable, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> would have the evening to begin at noon. What elſe could he mean by the <hi>two Evenings,</hi> which he in divers places mentioneth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.39. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.4.8. if he meant not thereby the time between noon and Sun-ſetting, <hi>viz.</hi> the time between the evening of the day in common uſe with the <hi>Jews</hi> which began at noon, and the evening of the day in their Sacred account, which began at Sun-ſetting, as I ſhewed before. <hi>See chap.</hi> 2. On the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of <hi>Abib,</hi> they were commanded, even the whole Aſſembly, to <hi>kill the Paſchal Lamb between the two Evenings,</hi> Exod. 12.6. as it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text; and to eat the ſame at the beginning of their Sacred day of the Paſſover, which began at Sun-ſetting, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.14. Their taking the Lamb, killing, skinning, and making it cool and fit for roaſting; yea the roaſting it, and preparing it with herbs for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all was to be done between the two evenings before the ſetting of the Sun. The killing their Paſſover (very likely) was about that very time of the day when Chriſt our Paſſover was ſlain, which was between the two evenings; The former of the two evenings mentioned by <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 12.6. began at noon, at the beginning of the ſeventh hour of the day with the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Lyranus, According to the Hebrew Doctors, the Evening here mentioned, beginneth from the ſeventh hour, for at that time the Sun beginneth to incline toward the Weſt.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the difference between thoſe four kinds of days.</head>
               <p>HAving ſhewed what all and every of thoſe four kinds of days are, I will now ſhew they differ from each other.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Artificial day differeth from all the other three, in that it hath
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152822:13"/> only day light and no night, but endeth at Sun-ſetting, whereas the other have night as well as day-light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Univerſal day differeth from Horizontal days, and Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional days in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Univerſal day is conſtant and unalterable; it cannot be made longer or ſhorter by all the Wit and Induſtry man can uſe, much leſs may a day thereof be gotten or loſt by mans indeavour. But week-days with all People whether they be Horizontal or Meridional days, may be either lengthned by travelling Weſtward, or ſhortned by travelling Eaſt, yea a whole day may thereby be either gotten or loſt, and ſo he that was the firſt born may become the younger brother; as in the Law-Caſe between <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Johannes:</hi> I will not affirm the ſtory to be true, but it will ſerve to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth of what I before ſaid, and let it be taken as I had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVilliam Douſe</hi> of <hi>Portingh</hi> had by his Wife <hi>Hellen</hi> two Sons at one birth, within one hour, and either of them was named <hi>John,</hi> but for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſake, the Father and others called the younger <hi>Johannes.</hi> When they came to be five and twenty years of age, <hi>John</hi> the Elder obtained moneys and leave of his Father to Travel with Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> when he made his Voyage round the World. <hi>Johannes</hi> lived at home with his Aged Father, his mother being dead; but did ſo miſ-behave himſelf toward his Father, that the Old man, by his continual vexation became ſo weak and faint, that he deſpaired of Life; yet before he died he heard that his Son <hi>John</hi> was returned into <hi>England</hi> ſafe with Sir <hi>Francis Drake:</hi> Whereupon he cauſed his Will to be altered and new Written, wherein he gave all his goods and Chattels to <hi>John</hi> his elder Son; ſaving only ten pounds, which he gave to <hi>John</hi> his Younger Son, and ſhortly after died. When <hi>John</hi> had heard of his Fathers death, he haſted home; but before his coming, <hi>Johannes</hi> had in poſſeſſion, and diſpoſed of all his Fathers Goods and Chattels left. Of all which <hi>John</hi> at his coming home demanded the poſſeſſion, to whom <hi>Johannes</hi> tendred only ten pounds, telling him that was all which his Father gave him, and therewithal gave him a Copy of his Fathers Will; telling him alſo that he by his Travel had loſt a day of his Age, and that he himſelf was <hi>John</hi> the Elder, when his Father made his laſt Will, and being poſſeſſed of the Goods he meant to keep them. <hi>John</hi> ſeeing his Brothers reſolution would not finger the ten pounds, but took the Copy of the Will, and haſted to <hi>Plowden,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Ployden,</hi> the Lawyer; to him he opened his Caſe, and ſhewed the Copy of the Will, craving his Counſel, <hi>Ployden</hi> having peruſed the Will, demanded of <hi>John</hi> who was firſt-born, that was I, quoth <hi>John,</hi> and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth and will acknowledge that. Why then your Caſe is good and ſure, and the Goods are all undoubtedly yours, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> but yet tell me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what pretence doth your Brother claim and detain them? Why quoth <hi>John,</hi> he ſaith, that by my Voyage that I made with Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> round about the World I loſt a day of my Age, and ſo he at the making of the Will was the Elder, and ſo layeth claim to all. Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> quoth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152822:14"/> 
                  <hi>Ployden,</hi> did take ſuch a Voyage indeed, but did you travel the whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit with him? It is true, quoth <hi>John,</hi> I did. Nay then the caſe is altered, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> and you have loſt a day of your age indeed. You be <hi>John Primogenitus,</hi> but your Brother is <hi>John Senior.</hi> This is ſtrange, quoth <hi>John,</hi> we kept a moſt exact account of every days Journey till we came home. Can you ſhew when or where we ſhould loſe a day? you loſt not your day, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> at any one Longitude, nor at one time, but by little and little. Anſwer me one queſtion, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> and thereby you ſhall make this clear your ſelf. It is a Problem that <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath, and now is common in uſe. The ſhip <hi>Argos,</hi> in which <hi>Jaſon</hi> ſailed for the Golden fleece, when the Voyage was ended, was laid up in the Road for a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: where decaying by little and little, they always pieced it anew where it wore away; till in the end the whole ſubſtance of the Old Veſſel was gone, and nothing remained thereof, but only the figure, which every where was anſwerable to that of the Old. Now tell me whether this ſhip was the very ſame in which <hi>Jaſon</hi> ſailed, or another diverſe from it? And if another, when it was changed? Sure, quoth <hi>John,</hi> it could not be the ſame ſhip, and it was altered by little and little, and at no time wholly altered till at the laſt. Juſt ſo, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> may I ſay for the day you have loſt, you loſt it not all at one time, but by little and little every degree that you went Weſtward, you pieced your day, and made it the three hundred and ſixtieth part of a day longer than it was, but therewithal you loſed the three hundred and ſixtieth part of your day in tale; you muſt look to loſe one way if you gain another way. In your travel of the whole round, which is three hundred and ſixty degrees, you gained a whole day in the length of your days, but you have loſt thereby a whole day in tale. For tell me, when it was Sunday at your coming home, what day was it then with you? Indeed, quoth <hi>John,</hi> it was but Saturday with us, and I wondered much, why we in the count of the days of our Week came ſtill to a day ſhort of what they counted here. But I pray tell me what counſel you will give me in the Caſe between me and my Brother? Why, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> be ruled by me and fear not: make one Voyage more, and go back the ſame way that you came, and you ſhall certainly find again the day which you loſt, and then come to me and I will warrant your Caſe. Though now I approve not <hi>Ploydens</hi> Judgment in every point, yet I ſay, what he told <hi>John</hi> of the lengthning of his days, and loſing a day in tale at his return, whereby he had not lived ſo many Week-days as his brother <hi>Johannes</hi> had by a day, is very true, whether he counted the Week by Horizontal or by Meridional days. But yet <hi>John</hi> lived as many Univerſal days as did his Brother and loſed not one hour, or minute of an hour in the Univerſal day; it could neither be lengthned or ſhortned by continual travel. When the Sun came to that Meridian, in which it was, when it began the fifth, ſixth or ſeventh day, at the firſt Creation, then did the Univerſal day end, and the next began both with <hi>John</hi> and with his Brother, though they were half the Compaſs of the Earth diſtant from each other.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:152822:14"/>2. Week-days, whether they be Horizontal or Meridional, cannot be the ſame in all places; much leſs can their parts or hours be the ſame. But the Univerſal day is not only the ſame day in all places, but every part or hour of that day is without any variation, the ſame every where.</p>
               <p>The laſt day in which Chriſt ſhall come to judge the World, which muſt needs be on two week days with People, if it be on Sunday with ſome, it will be on Saturday or Monday with ſome others; and on different times alſo of the week-day, if it ſhall be at mid-night with ſome, (not only mid-night of ſecurity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.6, 13, 24, 39, 50. but in reſpect of the week-day) it will be at noon with ſome others, &amp;c. Yet will it be one and the ſame Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal day, therefore every where in Holy Scripture that time is called a day, <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40, 54.11.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.15. not days. It ſhall not be on one day here, and on another day elſewhere, but on one and the ſame day. It will be a general day of Judgment; not only in reſpect of all conditions of men, but alſo of all places, they ſhall be gathered from the four Winds, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.27. from all quarters of the World. Yea his coming ſhall then be not only on one and the ſame Univerſal or general day, but on one and the ſame hour of that day in reſpect of all People. In an hour of that day the Trumpet ſhall ſound, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. then all in all places ſhall hear the Voice thereof at that ſame moment, even at the twinkling of an eye. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. In vain ſhall the Plea of any be, alledging that it is Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day then with ſome People, and it is but Monday with us: O let us tarry till Tuſeday too: or that it is but one of the Clock with us, and it is three or more with others, and therefore too ſoon for them. No, for their account of the day will not ſerve the turn. All ſhall find that hour to be a general hour, of a general or Univerſal day, that is, not ſooner in one place than in another.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The difference between Horizontal and Meridional days.</head>
               <p>THere is not a little difference between the Meridional and the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal day, as may appear by what hath been before ſaid.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They differ in length and duration, for the Meridional day, whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> counted the days of their Months, and we the days of our Weeks and Months, is in time four and twenty hours without any ſenſible difference. But the Horizontal day, by which the <hi>Jews</hi> count the days of their weeks, from Sun-ſetting to Sun-ſetting, (or from Sun-riſing to Sun-riſing, by which ſome other have counted the days of their week) is ſometimes in ſome places near five and twenty hours; and at ſome other time in the ſame places, it will be but about three and twenty hours in length.</p>
               <p>When I ſay the Horizontal day is the time between Sun-ſetting and Sun-ſetting;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152822:15"/> or between Sun-riſing and Sun-riſing; I mean ſo in all places in and between the temperate Zones; and not in places near either of the Poles, where it is continual day-light for many days together. From Sun-ſetting to Sun-ſetting, in thoſe places cannot properly be termed a day, having in it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny revolutions of the Sun, never was it in uſe with any People, to mete out unto them their Week, Month, Year or Age. Men living in ſuch places meaſure out their weeks and months by Meridional days as we do. Neither is there any mention made of ſuch days any where in Sacred Scripture, and it is of ſuch kind of days as are there mentioned, which I promiſed to ſpeak of. <hi>See chap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they differ much in reſpect of their beginning and ending. Here in <hi>York</hi> and other places of <hi>England,</hi> there is ſometimes five, ſometimes eight, and never ſo little as three hours difference between their beginnings; and the like between their endings. Whence it muſt follow, that every of the week-days with the <hi>Jews,</hi> conſiſted partly of two days of their month: and that every day of the month with them, conſiſted partly of two of their week-days; the days of their month being Meridional, and their days of the week Horizontal days, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>The knowledge hereof is very uſeful for the reconciling divers places, and reſolving divers doubts in the Sacred Scripture, about the <hi>Jews</hi> cuſtoms in obſerving their feaſts, as for inſtance, if it be demanded;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether the Iſraelites ate the Paſſover in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and came out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>from</hi> Rameſes <hi>on one and the ſame day; Sith it is ſaid, that on the fourteenth day at Even they ate the Paſſover,</hi> Exod. 12.8. <hi>but it was the next day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the morrow after,</hi> viz. <hi>the fifteenth day when they came from</hi> Rameſes. Numb. 33.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or whether our Saviour Chriſt ate the Paſſover with his Diſciples, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſuffered Death on the Croſs on one and the ſame day; Sith it was the fourteenth day at Even when he eat the Paſſover, and gave then his Body and Blood Sacramentally, when he inſtituted the Lords Supper, but it was the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day when he wrought our full Redemption, and actually and really gave his Body and Blood for us on the Croſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer to both theſe are the ſame. It was on one and the ſame day of their Week, but not of their month: for it was on the fourteenth day of <hi>Abib</hi> on which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ate the Paſſover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but their going out of <hi>Egypt</hi> from <hi>Rameſes</hi> was on the fifteenth day. So alſo Chriſt ate the Paſſover with his Diſciples on the fourteenth day of the firſt month, according to the Law of the Paſſover; but he was Crucified on the next day, which was the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day. <hi>In the fourteenth day of the firſt month at Even is the Lords Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp; on the fifteenth day of the ſame month is the Feaſt.</hi> Num. 28.16, 17. Lev. 23.15, 6. Yet both in one and the ſame day of their week, for the days of their week, ever after their freedom from ſlavery, were, as I ſhewed before, Horizontal days; every of which began at the Sun-ſetting of the former day, at the time they ate the Paſſover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo they were commanded to begin
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152822:15"/> their Sabbath days, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.32. and therefore ſo alſo did they begin the days of their week called the Sabbath, for meting out to them their Sabbath-days. And herein the Romaniſts do not a little Judaize, who continued the like cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of beginning all their Sacred days, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> tells us, <hi>In diem ſeriam,</hi> viz. <hi>decimam quartam, &amp;c. On the fourteenth day of the month, in the Even whereof the Lamb was ſacrificed, and the Solemnity of the Paſſover began, which was celebrated on the fifteenth day of the month. According to which cuſtom the Solemnities of our Church do begin with the evening of the day before going</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Lyra. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil. in Joan. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> Chriſt with the Diſciples ate the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and was Crucified alſo on one and the ſame week day, which was the ſixth day of the week with the <hi>Jews:</hi> which conſiſted partly of our Thurſday, and partly of our Friday: as their Sabbath-day conſiſted partly of our Friday, and partly of our Saturday.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be demanded, <hi>whether the demand made by the Diſciples, where they ſhould prepare the Paſſover, and their killing the Paſchal Lamb, and their eating the Paſſover, and</hi> Peters <hi>denial, and the Cocks Crowing were all done in the ſame day?</hi> The anſwer hereto is like the former. They were done in the ſame day of the month, but not in the ſame day of their week. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples demand the killing and preparing the Paſſover was all in the fifth day of their week, but their eating it, and <hi>Peters</hi> denial, and the Cocks Crowing were done on the ſixth day of their week: Yet all on the fourteenth day of the month, and all done on our day of the week which we call Thurſday.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be demanded, <hi>How we may conceive it to be on the firſt day of unleavened bread, in which the Diſciples asked of Chriſt where they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for him to eat the Paſſover; Sith the Evangeliſts</hi> Mark <hi>and</hi> Luke <hi>do affirm it to be on that day:</hi> Mar. 14.12. Luke 22.7. <hi>yet the firſt of the ſeven days of unleavened bread began not till the time of eating the Paſſover?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer is as before: The firſt day of the week of unleavened bread was not then begun, but the firſt day of the month of unleavened bread was begun long before. Though there was juſt one week or ſeven days of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread: yet were there eight days of the month of unleavened bread: On the fourteenth day of the firſt month, they were commanded to eat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, and ſo to the one and twentieth day at even, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.18. From the Even of one to the Even of the other, was juſt a week or ſeven days: but ſith they began to eat unleavened bread on the fourteenth day, according to the Commandment, that fourteenth day of the month was properly their firſt day of unleavened bread: and the one and twentieth was the eighth or laſt. Thus St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calleth the firſt of thoſe eight days in which they ate unleavened bread, <hi>the firſt day of the Feaſt of unleavened Bread. Mat.</hi> 26.17.</p>
               <p>The like anſwer is made unto thoſe who object out of <hi>John</hi> 13.1. that Chriſt ate not the Paſſover on the Feaſt-day of the Paſſover, but one day foregoing. And many more ſuch like queſtions and doubts may hereby be reſolved.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> What kind of day the Sabbath-day is. Not known when the day of Gods reſt beginneth.</head>
               <p>THe Sabbath-day of the Lord is not an Artificial day, which hath no night, nor is but a part of the Horizontal day. <hi>See chap.</hi> 1. For the Sabbath-day is proportionable unto the other ſix days of the week allowed for labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every of which hath a night or darkneſs as well as day-light: and in which night men may as lawfully labour as in the day-light. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> fled by night, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2 14. <hi>The Diſciples of Chriſt rowed by night, and in the fourth watch of the night Jeſus went to them,</hi> Mat. 14.25. Some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys are ſo hot, that their chiefeſt work is in the night, and ſo dangerous by reaſon of Wild Beaſts, that their chiefeſt care over their flocks is by night. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſpecial care over <hi>Labans</hi> flock was ſuch, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.40. And when Chriſt was born, an Angel brought the glad tidings thereof to the Shepherds by night as they were watching their flocks, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8. If the ſix days of labour which God alloweth Man be ſuch as have nights as well as day-lights, then ſuch ought the Sabbath-day of the Lord to be alſo.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Sabbath-day here commanded an Univerſal day, ſuch as was the very day of Gods reſt. For then there would have been an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in reſpect of the thing it ſelf, for men to keep the ſame, and that for theſe two reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is impoſſible for any man to know within half a year, what time of the year it is with us when the firſt year of the World began. Some have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to tell the ſame to a day: and in the <hi>Calendar</hi> prefixed to our Church-Bibles and Common Prayer Books, ſuppoſe it to be the five and twentieth day of <hi>March,</hi> and there the ſame day is ſuppoſed to be that in which Chriſt was Conceived in the Womb of the Virgin-<hi>Mary;</hi> which if granted, the thirtieth day of the ſame month of <hi>March,</hi> muſt be yearly the day of Gods Reſt. For if one be the firſt day of the Creation, the other muſt be the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>Again, Let it be, as ſuppoſed ſo granted, that the 25th. day of <hi>March</hi> yearly is truly the firſt day of the Creation; yet not a man living is there, that can tell within three days what day of our week that five and twentieth day of <hi>March</hi> was, which was the firſt day of the Creation. All the Art and indeavour of man is not ſufficient to find out whether the firſt day of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was Sunday or Saturday, or Monday, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore not whether the day of Gods Reſt was Thurſday, Friday, or Saturday.</p>
               <p>Let it yet be further granted that it was Sunday on which the firſt day of the Creation began, and therefore the day of Gods Reſt muſt then have its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning on Saturday; No man can for all that tell within eleven hours at what time of the Sunday the firſt day of the Creation, or at what time of the Saturday the day of Gods Reſt began either here, or in <hi>Virginia,</hi> or in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152822:16"/> 
                  <hi>Rome, Jeruſalem, Paradiſe,</hi> or in any other place whatſoever, whether it was at Sun-riſing, Sun-ſetting, noon, or at the hour of one or two, &amp;c. in the forenoon or afternoon. Wherefore, if by the ſeventh here commanded, had been meant an Univerſal day; it muſt be then that ſeventh Univerſal day on which God Reſted; the which cannot be obſerved by men, becauſe they cannot tell on what day of their week, nor about what time of their day, they ſhould begin the obſervation thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an Univerſal day, ſuch as was the day of Gods Reſt cannot be obſerved of all the People of God. Though it ſhould be granted, what is of ſome believed, that the day of God's Reſt began in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> on Saturday, and at the riſing of the Sun there; yet all Gods People cannot obſerve that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The earth being Global, and the true longitude of the place where <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was, being unknown, no man can tell when to begin that day in the place where he liveth. We know when it is Saturday in ſome places, it is then Sunday or Friday in ſome other places. We know that when Chriſt Roſe from the Grave, it was then Sunday at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the fore-noon, and we know that it was then Saturday in <hi>Virginia</hi> in the afternoon, but no man can knowingly ſay that the day of Gods Reſt beginneth on the Saturday, in the forenoon with him, though it be granted that it ſo began in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the day of Gods Reſt, (or any other Univerſal day) be made known unto men, at what time, and on what day it began in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> and the very place where <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was made known alſo: Yet all Gods People could not poſſibly keep that very day of Gods Reſt; By reaſon of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Longitudes of the Places wherein they may Live, they cannot keep all of them one and the ſame day.</p>
               <p>This hath been proved unto us fully and plainly, even by the oppoſers of the Sabbath. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath even demonſtrated the ſame, that men could not poſſibly have kept one and the ſame day for their Sabbath <hi>had it been commanded.</hi>

                  </note> from the diverſity of Meridians, proveth that one and the ſame day cannot be Univerſally kept, and therefore never commanded the whole Church. One and the ſame day could not poſſibly be obſerved a Sabbath by all the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Eaſt-parts and Weſt-parts too of <hi>Judea,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of their diverſity of Longitudes. And if it be ſuppoſed to be but two or three degrees difference of Longitude; yet will that difference make the days as truly to differ from being the ſame, as will an hundred and three, though it will not make them ſo much to differ. The like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hath Doctor <hi>Francis White</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis White,</hi> in his Treat. of the Sabb. pag. <hi>175.</hi>
                  </note>, and divers others. Wherefore ſith the Univerſal day, ſuch as was the day of Gods Reſt, cannot be poſſibly kept by all Gods People,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152822:17"/> no more than any other ſet particular day can, it is not the day here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath-day here commanded to be kept Holy, is ſuch a kind of day, as may be known, kept, and obſerved by men, whereſoever they inhabit; though in many and divers Longitudes of the Earth. Such as might have been kept in the Wilderneſs where the Law was delivered; and in the Eaſt and Weſt-parts of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon, Rome, Spain,</hi> and in all other habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places, and therefore ought to be either an Horizontal, or elſe a Meridio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal day. In all places of the World, none other but Horizontal or Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal days are now, or at any other time heretofore have been in uſe with men, for meaſuring out unto them their ſeven days or week: and ſuch as are their ſix days of the week for Labour, ſuch ought the ſeventh day, even the day for Holy Reſt to be alſo. The Sabbath-day with the <hi>Jews</hi> was an Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal day, but then ſuch were the other days of their week alſo: and what Nation ſoever have their week to conſiſt of Horizontal days, ought to have their Sabbath-day to be ſo alſo. In the North of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> and Queen of <hi>Swedens</hi> Countreys, where the Sun maketh many Revolutions at ſome ſeaſons of the year between his riſing and ſetting, men cannot count their week by Horizontal days, but they do and have counted their weeks by Meridional days. And ſo do all Chriſtians generally of what Longitude or Latitude of the Earth ſoever they are, mete out their weeks by Meridional days, then ſuch ought their ſeventh day of their week to be alſo.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> What day the Sabbath is to be in order or tale.</head>
               <p>NOw is to be ſhewn what day in tale is to be the Lords day, or Sabbath of the Lord, and this the Law-giver himſelf hath plainly pointed out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in this Law, to be the day following the ſix days of labour, ſo that none need to ſay the knowledge hereof is hidden from us; Who ſhall aſcend for us into Heaven, and bring the knowledge thereof to us, that we may know it and obſerve it? But it is clearly demonſtrated unto us by the Lord God, ſo that he that worketh with the Spade, may know the ſame as well as he that handleth the Pen. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour, and, &amp;c. but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> The ſeventh day, that is, the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſix known days of labour, is none of ours, it is the Lords day.</p>
               <p>We may not make the Sabbath-day to be the ſixth day, for then we ſhould ſhew our ſelves unthankful, in not receiving the Lords own bountiful allowance: nor the eighth day, for then we ſhould encroach on the Lords right, and not be contented with his Liberal allowance of ſix days for our ſelves, reſerving only the ſeventh for himſelf, much leſs ought we to make
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152822:17"/> it the fifth, or the ninth or tenth, or any other than the ſeventh day. Our weeks are not to conſiſt of more or leſs than ſeven days, the laſt day whereof is the Lords day.</p>
               <p>Some call this day the ſtanding day of the week for Gods Worſhip, ſome the Lords day, ſome the Sabbath of the Lord, ſome the ſeventh day of the week, and in this Law it is ſet out to be the day after our ſix days of labour. Though theſe appellations do much differ in Letter, Sound and Phraſe, yet they all ſignifie the ſame thing; it cannot be the ſeventh day of the week, but it will alſo be the day after our ſix known days of labour, and the ſtanding day of the week for Gods Worſhip: this is the Lords day, or the Sabbath of the Lord, or to the Lord: and this is not only a ſeventh day of the week, as all and every other of the week-days are, but it is the ſeventh day of the week <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>There is not appointed from the Lord by this Law any ſet time, whence men ſhould begin their week or ſevening, for to find the Lords day: ſo that no People, <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> are tyed by this Commandment, directly to keep their Sabbath preciſely on ſuch or ſuch a day; or to begin their Sabbath, at any ſet particular time; as from midnight, or from Sun-riſing, noon or Sunſetting.</p>
               <p>God ſeparated the tenth of Grapes, of Lambs, of Corn, &amp;c. to the uſe of the Prieſts and <hi>Levites.</hi> As the ſeventh day is in this Commandment ſaid to be the Lords, and ſanctified by the Lord, ſo were thoſe tenths ſaid to be the Lords, and Sanctified or Holy to the Lord: But it cannot there be meant of the very tenth Lamb that fell in order from the Damm, or of the tenth ear of Corn, or of the tenth cluſter of Grapes, firſt appearing or grown ripe; this was too too difficult for to find out; but of the tenth in proportion ſucceſſively, according to the cuſtomary manner of their Tithing in the places where they lived. No more can it be meant here of the ſeventh day from the firſt beginning of the Creation, which cannot be found out, nor from any particular time ſet by the Lord, but the ſeventh day in proportion ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, according as any Nation or People do cuſtomarily begin their week, in what Longitude of the Earth ſoever they do inhabit: that ſeventh day by the expreſs words of this Law is the Lords day, or Sabbath-day to or for the Lord, not of the Lord in that ſenſe which ſome take it, as if it were the very day of Gods Reſt, but the ſeventh day unto the Lord, that is, Sacred or Holy to or for the Lord: ſo do the very words of the Text import, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152822:18"/> man for labour, is the Lords day, or is Sacred to the Lord thy God. As we ſay in Tithing of Corn, whereſoever men by agreement do begin the Tithe, that nine Cocks or Stacks of Corn are the Farmers, but the tenth is the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or is due to the Parſon: So in ſevening out our days, at what time ſoever, according to mens cuſtom they begin their week or ſevening; ſix days are ours, but the ſeventh day is the Lords, it is his due, and not our own. God hath not bound men by this Law to any ſet time, when to begin their week, either at the Sun-ſetting, as the <hi>Jews</hi> begin their week, or at midnight, as Chriſtians begin theirs, or at any other ſet time, but in every Nation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they begin their week, the ſeventh day thereof is the Lords.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had a ſet time when they ſhould begin their week or ſevening; and ſo had a ſet and peculiar time or day on which they were to keep their Sabbath: but this they were not bound unto by this Law. That Saturday was their ſeventh or Sacred day, and that it began at Sun-ſetting, rather than at another time, was not by any expreſs out of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but accidentally: that thereby they might be the better taken off from the Aſſyrians idolatry, wherewith they and generally moſt Nations, were deeply infected; of which I will ſpeak more particularly in the next Chapter.</p>

And a little after; <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum omnium Sanctorum inſtituitur à</hi> Bonifacio <hi>quarto.</hi> Then at that time I ſuppoſe were the Images of the Saints placed up on high in their Rood, which common People here with us call their Roodloft, in imitation of the Heathen. For commonly when the Romiſh Church put down any Idolatrous cuſtom of the Heathen, then they ſet up another reſembling that which they put down; and this did they either for avoiding the greater ſcandal of the Heathen, which were then potent; or to win them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by degrees to Chriſtian Religion or for ſome other by reſpect.</p>
               <p>As the Heathen had ſome one or other particular Planet or Idol, to be the Patron and Protector of ſome one People or other, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſo many Protectors as there were nations: <hi>Belus</hi> for <hi>Aſſyria; Diana</hi> for <hi>Epheſus; Jupiter</hi> for <hi>Rome; Juno</hi> for <hi>Samos; Bacchus</hi> for <hi>Thebes, &amp;c.</hi> So when that Idolatry was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, inſtead of theſe Idols, the Roman Church had Holy Saints to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated; and had for Protectors in like manner. Thus was St. <hi>James</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> St. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> St. <hi>Andrew</hi> for <hi>Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> As the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolaters had for ſeveral occaſions, ſeveral Gods and Goddeſſes on whom

               <p>Secondly, For that, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> telleth us, the Learned Doctors expound theſe words of <hi>Ezechiel, And lo they put the branch to their Noſe</hi>

                  </note>; <hi>thus their Idols were lifted up aloft, therefore the Idolaters reached up Rods or branches to touch them; and after that, they put their Rods or Branches to their mouths or noſes, in reverence to their Idols.</hi> Had not their Idols been placed aloft in manner as the Images of the Saints afterwards were, I ſuppoſe thoſe Doctors would not have given ſuch an Interpretation of that Text. The placing of the Idols of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152822:21"/> then in ſuch manner as is before ſaid, I confeſs is my Opinion, and for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before given, which if they ſeem weak to any, I leave the ſame to his better judgment, not willing to conteſt againſt any herein, being not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great concernment. But that the Planets were the proper Gods of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> of Old time, and that the days of the week were firſt ſo called by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> according to the names of the Planets, which they Worſhipped and had for their Gods, as I before ſaid, is not mine Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion only, but Learned men have teſtified as much.

And to the end they might acknowledge God alone to be the Creator; their Sabbath day was ſet unto them, &amp;c<note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <p>It is very true indeed that Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith of them, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their Idolatries. Inſomuch, that when the Lord brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to be a peculiar people to himſelf, God then uſed many means to draw them off from Worſhipping the Sun, Moon, and the reſt of the Planets, all called the Hoſt of Heaven, whereof the Sun was the chief.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God gave them a ſpecial charge that thenceforth not any of them ſhould ſerve the Sun, or Moon, &amp;c. And that if any Man or Woman among them ſhould be known to ſerve the Sun, or Moon, or any of the Hoſt of Heaven, then the party, whether Man or Woman was to be ſtoned to Death without mercy. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God charged them not to ſpeak of thoſe Gods, or to have their names come out of any of their mouths, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.13. They might not call the days of the week by the names of the Planets, the day of the Sun, the day of the Moon, &amp;c. as other Nations did, and do for the moſt part: but they called them thenceforth <hi>the firſt of the Sabbath, the ſecond of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> &amp;c. Inſomuch that all the Evangeliſts in recording the day and time of our Saviours Reſurrection, ſay not, <hi>In the morning of the day of the Sun,</hi> as other Nations commonly called that time, and we now, <hi>In the Sunday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but, <hi>In the morning of the firſt day of the Sabbath:</hi> ſo did they call our Sunday. St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, though he wrote to the Church in <hi>Corinth,</hi> yet wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the behalf of ſome <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Judea</hi> that were in want, called their weekly meeting day, not the day of the Sun, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> call'd that day, but the firſt day of the Sabbath, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. being the proper name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true that St. <hi>John</hi> (though he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> yet writing not to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> lately converted<note n="(b)" place="margin">Diod. in loc.</note>, that is, to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia, Rev.</hi> 1.4.) called <hi>our Sunday,</hi> not by the name
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152822:23"/> of the day of the Sun as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> called it, nor by the name of the <hi>firſt day of the Sabbath,</hi> as he and the <hi>Jews</hi> commonly called it, but he called it <hi>The Lords day. John</hi> called it not the day of the Sun, for he was a <hi>Jew;</hi> nor did he call it <hi>the firſt day of the Sabbath,</hi> for that he wrote to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> to whom the name of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was odious, as was the name <hi>of the day of the Sun</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and we find not that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who deſcended of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did in many years after this uſe the name of Sabbath in their Writings: nor did the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe the name of <hi>the day of the Sun</hi> in theirs. But <hi>John</hi> called it the <hi>Lords day,</hi> being as truly the Lords day with the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as was the Saturday with the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord cauſed them to alter their times which were meaſured out to them by the courſe of the Sun, as years, months, weeks and days.

                  </note> the Lord confirmed this new order of their week-days miraculouſly; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as on that ſeventh pointed out unto them for their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, there was no ſign of Manna to be ſeen; and the portion thereof gathered the day before, and kept unto their Sabbath-day, ſtank not. The miraculous feeding them many years after this manner bred in them a cuſtom of obſerving the week according to this new aſſignment. The Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> cauſed them to alter the beginning of their days of the week too, for whereas before they began their days, as other Worſhippers of the Sun did, at the firſt appearance of the Sun in the Horizon, counting the firſt hour of their day to begin at Sun-riſing, thenceforth they muſt begin their day for the ſervice of God, when the Sun is furtheſt off from his riſing. Sun-riſing was the time when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> began their Worſhip to the Sun, but theirs muſt begin at Sun-ſetting. Their evening Sacrifice, was their prime Sacrifice. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. Their Feaſt of the Paſſover muſt be at the ſetting of the Sun, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.6. and their Sabbaths muſt begin with the evening; from evening to evening were they to celebrate their Sabbaths, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.32. that ſo they may the better remember and acknowledge the Lord God their Creator and Governour; that it was he, and not the Sun, Moon or Hoſt of Heaven, that wrought their great deliverance in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:152822:24"/>
               <p>Fourthly, To bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the greater diſlike and deteſtation of Worſhipping the Sun towards the Eaſt, as the Nations did, the Lord would that they ſhould turn their breech or back-parts toward the Sun-riſing when they Worſhipped him. The Idolatrous Nations in thoſe days, when they Worſhipped the Sun, Moon, or any of the Hoſt of Heaven, bowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, that is, towards the Sun-riſing in Honour of the Sun; but now in contempt of that Idolatry, the <hi>Jews</hi> were to have their faces toward the Weſt or Sunſetting; and their breech toward the Sun-riſing, when they bowed and Worſhipped God. The Holy place therefore in the Tabernacle was toward the Weſt, as D. <hi>Willet</hi> proveth<note n="(a)" place="margin">Willet. Syn. Can. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note>. And when the Temple of God was built, the houſe of God was ſo placed in the inner Court, as that they who came thither to pray, when they bowed, had their Poſteriours, (as it is in the Hebrew) towards the Sun-riſing, and their faces Weſtward towards the houſe of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The day of the Sun muſt no longer be their ſeventh Sacred day. The having that day Sacred might have nurſed them in, or have drawn them again to the ſaid Idolatry of Worſhipping the Sun; but that they might be taken wholly off from it, the day of the Sun was to be with them common or prophane, and another day, the day before the day of the Sun, even that which was the ſeventh from their firſt gathering Quails and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.12, 13, 23, 26. The day which the Antient <hi>Saxons</hi> called the day of <hi>Seater,</hi> and we from them <hi>Saturday,</hi> was thenceforth to be their ſeventh-day Sacred.</p>
               <p>Yet all theſe courſes which the moſt wiſe God took with them prevailed not, they would not be reclaimed from their Idolatry, they were reſolved to uphold their wicked cuſtom; not only the meaner ſort, but <hi>the Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>the Princes, the Prieſts and wicked Prophets, Loved, Sought, Served, Worſhipped, and Walked after the Sun, Moon, &amp;c. Jer.</hi> 8.1, 2. Great charges were their Kings at, for making Horſes and Chariots, which they Dedicated to the Sun; the which good <hi>Joſiah</hi> afterward in zeal to the Lord of Hoſts did burn with fire. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.11. Yet could he not root out this monſtrous abomination of VVorſhipping the Sun, but they ſtrengthned themſelves therein, inſomuch that even in the Temple of God, in the place where they ſhould VVorſhip the Lord of Glory, with their faces VVeſtward towards the houſe of God, they would in a moſt high contempt Worſhip the Sun; and bow with their breech towards the houſe of God, having their faces towards the Sun-riſing; Of which contempt the Lord complaineth to his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to whom he ſhewed their great aboninations, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea and greater than thoſe; at length he ſhewed him this which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all the other. <hi>Turn thee again,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and thou ſhalt ſee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abominations than theſe, and he brought me into the inner Court of the Lords houſe, and behold, at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the Porch and the Altar, were about five and twenty men, with their Poſteriors toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the Eaſt: and they VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152822:24"/> the Sun towards the Eaſt.</hi> Ezek. 8.15, 16. The Women were reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to Worſhip the Moon too, after the manner of the Heathen. <hi>We will certainly do,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17, 18. <hi>whatſoever thing goeth out of our own mouth, to burn incenſe to the Queen of Heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our Fathers, our Kings and our Princes,</hi> in <hi>the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>and in the ſtreets of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Heatheniſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men againſt their time of Child-bearing, ſought and implored the Moon for eaſe and ſafety; the like cuſtom the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Women ſeemed to have had, who did knead their Dough to make Cakes to the Queen of Heaven, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.18. Of this I will be ſparing of my own, but deliver you the very words of that Learned <hi>John Gregory,</hi> as he layeth them down in his <hi>Aſſyrian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> thus. <hi>The</hi> Aſſyrians <hi>VVorſhipped the Moon under the name of</hi> Mylitta, which word <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath well noted, in their Language ſignifieth <hi>Genetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi> in which ſenſe it may not unaptly be applyed to the Moon. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he gives for it, is, for that; <hi>If the Moon did nothing help the ſecond cauſes in Generation, yet in the bringing forth it is evident, for this is moſt certain, though every Mid-wife hath not obſerved ſo much, that the moſt eaſy delivery a VVoman can have, is always in the increaſe toward, and in the full of the Moon, and the hardeſt labours in the new and ſilent Noon; which was the reaſon that the Mid-wives heretofore,</hi> (he meaneth among the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as the <hi>Heathen) did always in ſuch a Caſe implore the aid of that Planet, for the ſafe and eaſie delivery of their Infants; an example hereof you may have, one among many in the Comedy</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Terent. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</note>, <hi>where the VVoman in the extremity of her Travel cries out to the Moon,</hi> Juno Lucina fer opem, <hi>and this amongſt others muſt needs be a reaſon why the</hi> Aſſyrians <hi>VVorſhipped the Moon, and why they VVorſhipped her under that name. The Prophet</hi> Jeremy <hi>maketh mention of this VVorſhip in the ſeventh Chapter, where he calleth the Moon the Queen of Heaven, as our</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tranſlation hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well rendred. The reaſon which he giveth why the VVomen called upon the Moon at ſuch times, I omit here to relate, being the ſame which Phyſicians commonly do give. The Prophet addeth that the VVomen made Cakes to this Queen. This Cuſtom of offering Cakes to the Moon, our Anceſtors may ſeem not to have been ignorant of; to this day our VVomen make Cakes at ſuch times, yea the Child it ſelf is no ſooner Born, but 'tis Baptized into the names of theſe Cakes, for ſo the VVomen call their Babes Cake-Bread.</hi> So much <hi>John Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and more.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> forſook the Covenant of their God, and went a Whoring after the Gods of the Nations, chiefly after the Sun: yet the Lord was not wanting, in affording the many means aforeſaid for reclaiming them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this was not the leaſt, in that he took them off from the memory of the day of the Sun, and aſſigned unto them the Saturday for their Sabbath. Concerning which we may truly ſay, that as their Sabbath-day was their ſeventh day from their firſt gathering Quails and Manna, and as it was to begin at Sun-ſetting (which <hi>Moſes</hi> termed the ſeaſon that they came out of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152822:25"/> 
                  <hi>Egypt) Deut.</hi> 16.6. ſo was it Ceremonial; a ſign and token whereby they were known to be Gods peculiar People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. and diſtinguiſhed from all Nations that adored the Sun. Unto the obſervation of which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, from their firſt labouring for Manna were they bound, and none but they; and they no longer than till the coming of him, of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> their Captain ſaid, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him ſhall ye hear,</hi> Acts 7.37. <hi>Even Jeſus Chriſt who is the Captain of our Salvation:</hi> Heb. 2.10. who is greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> who brought us out of a greater bondage than <hi>Moſes</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and who gave us not Quails and Manna, but his own fleſh; he gave us the true Bread that came down from Heaven, that we might live through him. After whoſe coming, as all other ſhaddows and Ceremonies, ſo this of their Saturday-Sabbath from Sun-ſetting to Sun-ſetting did vaniſh alſo. The day of Saturn was thenceforth no more Holy than the day of the Sun. The <hi>Jews</hi> might as lawfully, with their general conſent, have kept the Sabbath on Sunday as on the Saturday. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> practice taught Chriſtians then, that difference of days was taken away. <hi>Unto the Jews,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I became as a Jew,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20. When he was with the <hi>Jews</hi> he kept the Saturday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.2. <hi>and</hi> 18.4. <hi>and</hi> 13, 14.42. But when he was with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were turned unto Chriſt, and imbraced the Goſpel, he obſerved and kept the ſame ſeventh Sacred day they did, which with them was called the day of the Sun, on which day they uſually met together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. There aroſe no ſmall difference between the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> and the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> hereabout. The <hi>Jews</hi> eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Saturday to be more Holy than the Sunday, condemned the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> for Prophaners of the Sabbath, becauſe they obſerved not the Saturday: and for that they kept the day of the Sun, the <hi>Jews</hi> held them to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Sun as other <hi>Gentiles</hi> were. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> on the other ſide upbraided the <hi>Jews</hi> as ſuperſtitious, for their obſerving their ſet Holy-days, (whereof their Saturday-Sabbath from evening to evening was one) which were aboliſhed. This upbraiding and condemning one another in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh againſt, and writeth to the contrary in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 14.5. and to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Col. 2.16. The <hi>Jews</hi> were no more bound thenceforth by the Law of God, to keep their Sabbath on the Saturday than on the Sunday. The Sabbath-day by the Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to them, and to all in this Law, being not this or that day, but the ſeventh, relating to the ſix days of our labour before-going, is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the week with all People. Now that it may the better appear what the ſeventh day of the week is, and that Sunday is the ſeventh day of the week with us, and generally with all Chriſtians, I will ſhew,</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> The Opinion of ſome concerning weeks. How it's hatched from the Earths ſuppoſed plainneſs.</head>
               <p>IT hath been the general Opinion, not only of the Vulgar, but of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo, that the ſeventh day commanded us in this Law, hath relation only to the ſix work-days of the Lord God, and not to the ſix work-days with men, as if the meaning of theſe words of the Commandment, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour and do all thy VVork, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord thy God,</hi> (ſo it is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) ſhould be thus: <hi>The ſix days in which I wroutgh when I Created all things, ſhall be thy ſix work-days, in them thou ſhalt do all thy VVork, but the ſeventh day wherein I reſted, thou ſhalt reſt, and do none of thy VVorks on any part of that day; but ſhalt keep that day Holy, it is the day of my Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence they will have a week to be none other with any People, but ſeven ſuch days, whereof the ſix former days be the ſame with the firſt ſix days of the Creation, and the ſeventh be the ſame with the day of Gods Reſt. Weeks in uſe with the <hi>Jews</hi> they held to be ſuch; the firſt ſix days of their week, to be the ſame with the ſix days on which God wrought; and their ſeventh day, which was from Friday at the ſetting of the Sun to Saturdays Sun-ſetting, to be the very day of Gods Reſt. Though Sunday be the day following the ſix days of labour with us, and on which we reſt from our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, having wrought ſix days before, yet we do not reſt on the ſeventh day (as they ſay) according to Gods example; but on the firſt day: from Sunday to Sunday they will not have to be a week, but from Saturday to Saturday only.</p>
               <p>And from hence do they, who deny the Morality of the ſeventh-day-Sabbath teach and write, that the boundary or ſeventh day of the week muſt be the day of Gods Reſt; and that the day of Gods Reſt was the very day which God Bleſſed and Sanctified, and in this Law commanded to be kept holy, and that the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath only was the ſeventh-day Sabbath, which in this Law is commanded to be obſerved Holy; and that the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath-day being Ceremonial, and aboliſhed by the coming of the Meſſias,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152822:26"/> the ſeventh-day-Sabbath in this Law expreſly commanded to be Sanctified, is aboliſhed alſo, and not to be obſerved by <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and that ſith no other ſet day is inſtituted in ſtead thereof by any Divine Authority, it reſteth in the boſom of the Church or Magiſtrates, to appoint what day they pleaſe for Gods publick Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Though all and every of theſe be very falſe, yet are they all by theſe men held to be even as true as their Creed; they little conſidering from how unſound and rotten a root, theſe and every of them have had their firſt ſpring, and that is from a ſuppoſal that the Earth is plain, and not round.</p>
               <p>It is an odd, but an Old conceit of ſome Philoſophers, which afterward was held and maintained by the Antient Fathers, that the Earth was not ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd, but plain as a Champaign-field. They thought there could be no dwellers under the earth which go foot to foot againſt us: and that if there ſhould be any Antipodes imagined, yet them not to be <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, whom they held to have all dwelt upon the Earth, and to have been all drowned except eight perſons, when <hi>Noahs</hi> flood covered all the face of the Earth. So ſtrong did this Opinion prevail with the ſaid Fathers, as that whoever held the contrary, was counted near as bad as an Heretick. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Vigilius</hi> whom ſome call <hi>Virgilius,</hi> who was complained of by <hi>Boniface</hi> unto <hi>Zachary</hi> then Pope, and was degraded for holding that there were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes, and that they had a Sun and Moon to ſhine unto them as well as to us. This ſtory may be ſeen in <hi>Aventine</hi>

                  </note>, and in <hi>Baronius,</hi> who ſought to cover the fact with fig-leaves.</p>
               <p>Now that the Adverſaries to the Morality of this Law held all thoſe tenents before-ſaid and that they all ſprang from this errour of the Earths ſuppoſed plain ſuperficies, I will next ſhew. For the clearing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I need not cite many of them, one may ſerve for all, being approved by them all. Neither will I tell here all that he Writes hereabout, but that which chiefly concerns the point in hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ironſide</hi> a Reverend Divine, and of ſingular gifts and Parts, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayed by the ſtream of late times, doth in his book called the <hi>Seven Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the Sabbath,</hi> Dedicated to the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Laud,</hi> tell us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is neceſſary, not only for the Learned, but alſo for the weak and inferiour ſort of People, to know to a minute when the Lords-day or Sabbath doth begin, and when it doth end, and that for two ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The one is for the Peace and quiet of their Conſciences, which elſe would be wounded and diſquieted. The other is, for that unleſs the very day and the whole day be kept to a minute, all the duties done on that day are loſt. His words words are theſe.</p>
               <q>It is neceſſary to inquire of the dimenſions of this day, of what duration and continuance of time it muſt be<note n="(b)" place="margin">Irenſ. <hi>7.</hi> Queſt. pag. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>. Amongſt thoſe things which diſquiet and perplex the Conſciences of the weak, concerning the Lords day, this is not the leaſt, where it is to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152822:26"/> begin, and how long it laſteth. For God requiring of us perfect and intire obedience, without diminution or defalcation; unleſs every minute of time, which the Lord requireth of us as his tribute and homage, be duly tendred to him; our whole labour beſtowed upon the parts and pieces of the day is not regarded<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 126.</note>. It is alſo that which concerns the moſt ſort of our inferiour People to be ſatisfied in, leſt the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requiring one thing, their imployments another they many times wound their Conſciences, and rob themſelves of that Peace, which otherwiſe they might enjoy<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 127.</note>.</q>
               <p n="2">2ly, That God might have his due tribute, and the weak (if they will) may keep their Conſciences quiet in obſerving the true and full time of the Sabbath, he ſetteth down the preciſe day of the Sabbath (as he conceiveth) and the exact time to a minute when the Sabbath-day is to begin. As for the day, he tells us that the Sabbath-day, muſt be preciſely the day of Gods Reſt; Thus, <q>Aſſoon as God had ended his VVork, he ordained and appointed, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, the day of his own Reſt, <hi>(elſe he will not conceive that it can be the ſeventh day)</hi> ſhould be that on which the Church ſhould reſt<note n="(c)" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>As for the exact time when the Sabbath is to begin and end, he tells us, that the very minute in which the Sun is in the Horizon at his riſing, is the true beginning of the day, and he proveth that it muſt ſo be, for that when the fourth day at the Creation began, the Sun was then in the Horizon at his riſing, ſo that any of the inferior ſort of People, he before ſpake of, may by looking in his Almanack, tell to a minute (if Mr. <hi>Ironſides</hi> rule fail him not) at any time throughout all the year, and in any place throughout the World, when the fourth day of the Creation, and the very day of Gods Reſt, and ſo conſequently when the Sabbath beginneth. Theſe are his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the natural day be meaſured by the Revolution of the Sun, as all confeſs, ſure it is that untill the Sun begin his courſe, the day cannot begin. At what time now did the Sun ſet forth, upon the fourth day at the Creation? Common reaſon will ſay, when he firſt appeared in the Horizon. The riſing therefore of the Sun in the Horizon, muſt needs be the firſt Period of the Natural day</hi>

               <p n="3">3ly, He tells us that the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath-day was the day of Gods Reſt; and the ſame with that which God bleſſed and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, making no difference between all theſe three. His words are theſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>That particular Sabbath-day given unto the</hi> Jews, <hi>even the day of Gods Reſt, is not a Sabbath, but the Sabbath, even that which God ſanctifyed, The Sabbath muſt be the ſame with the ſeventh, or elſe there is no tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe or congruity in that Law.</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 70.</note> Whereas he ſaith the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152822:27"/> ſame with the ſeventh, he meaneth by the ſeventh, the ſeventh day from the Creation, even the very day of Gods Reſt; which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to begin at the riſing of the Sun like as the fourth day did.</q>
               <p>Now whereas ſome may, and that not without juſt cauſe, doubt how the day of Gods Reſt which began at Sunriſing (as he ſaith) and the <hi>Jews</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which ever began at the ſetting of the Sun whereſoever they dwelt, could be one and the ſame day. Sith that they, as well in reſpect of their beginnings, as alſo in reſpect of their endings are Heavenly wide the one from the other: even as far as the Sun-riſing is diſtant from Sun-ſetting; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both which there muſt be half a days difference. And ſo the day of Gods Reſt muſt begin either at Sun-riſing before the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; or at the Sun-riſing after. If at the Sun-riſing before, that is, on the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning; then the <hi>Turks</hi> Sabbath (ſo Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Heyl. part. <hi>1.</hi> page <hi>48.</hi>
                  </note> calleth it) may more truly be called the day of Gods Reſt, than that of the <hi>Jews:</hi> But if at the Sun-riſing after; then our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sabbath-day ever began on the day of Gods Reſt, the which the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath never did.</p>
               <p>For the wiping off this, and all ſuch doubts, Mr. <hi>Ironſide</hi> tells us both at what time, and alſo by what means the day of Gods Reſt and the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath was made to be one and the ſame day; which were always two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. His words are.</p>
               <q>VVhen God Commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> their Sabbaths from evening ot evening, the order of the Natural day was inverted by him; not ſo much looking to the number of four and twenty hours, as to the time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which began when the Paſſover was eaten at Even<note n="(b)" place="margin">Iron. p. <hi>138.</hi>
                  </note>, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>His meaning in theſe his Words may be conceived to be this: When God Commanded the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to keep their Sabbath on the Saturday, and to begin the ſame at the Sun-ſetting of the day before-going, that is, on Friday at the ſetting of the Sun, God mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly at an inſtant turned the Eaſt into the Weſt, and ſo the place of Sun-riſing came unto the place of Sun-ſetting ſo cloſe, as they kiſſed each other, as he ſaith, <hi>the end of one contiguum is the beginning of the other</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Iron. p. <hi>138.</hi>
                  </note>. If ſuch ſhould not be his meaning; it is not to be conceived how he ſhould make Sun-riſing, and Sun-ſetting, or the day of Gods Reſt, which he ſaith, began at Sun-riſing, and the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath, which began at Sun-ſetting, to be one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly; He tells us that the obſervation of the Sabbath is abrogated; this error is ſtrong with him, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath-day is abrogated; he thinking no difference to be made between the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath-day, and the Sabbath day here in this Law Commanded to be kept Holy; whereas they differ, as doth the <hi>ſpecies</hi> from its <hi>Genus.</hi> And from hence he inferreth that it wholly reſteth in the power of the Church, and Magiſtrates to appoint the time for Gods publick Worſhip. His words are theſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:152822:27"/>The obſervation of that Sabbath which is pretended to have been Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> is abrogated by Chriſt, as he is the Meſſias, even that day on which God Reſted, and which he Sanctified<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iron. pa. <hi>12.</hi>

               <p>Now if any reaſonable man will weigh theſe tenets of Mr. <hi>Ironſide,</hi> he may plainly perceive that they, and every of them do flow from the ſuppoſal of the Earths plainneſs.

Though the day of the coming of the Son of Man in Glory be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and likewiſe the hour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at midnight, or at the Cock-crowing, or at the day-dawning; yet if it ſhall be on the Saturday with ſome, it ſhall be on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday with all; and if it be at midnight with ſome, it ſhall be at mid-night with all; or if at the Cock-crowing or at the day-daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with ſome, then ſo ſhall it be with all.</p>

The ſeventh day which God bleſſed and ſanctified, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Law to be kept Holy, was the very day of Gods Reſt, which (after God had inverted the day, turning morning into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) came to be the ſame day with the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath where ever they dwelt; and began at Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in all places wherever the <hi>Jews</hi> abode, as in <hi>Arabia Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Babylon, Room, Spain, Ophyr,</hi> and in all other places, where the <hi>Jews</hi> had never any abiding place; for all places having one and the ſame Horizon, muſt have their day to be one and the ſame, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at one and the ſame time.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. As People are diſtant in place, ſo have they different Horizons, and as their Horizons differ, ſo do their week-days from being the very ſame.</p>

The day of Gods Reſt, which is the ſeventh day from the Creation, is the ſame Univerſal day with all People, but it cannot be the ſame day of the week with all People. If the day of Gods Reſt be Saturday with ſome, it muſt needs be Friday or Sunday with ſome other People. So likewiſe the time of Chriſts coming to Judge the World, if it be on the Saturday with ſome, it will not be on the Saturday with all, but on the Sunday or Friday with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, alſo if it be at mid-night with ſome, it ſhall be at Cock-crowing with other ſome, and at day dawning with ſome others, but it will not be at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night with all: nor at Cock-crowing, nor at day-dawning with all.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. As the day of Gods Reſt cannot be the Saturday, nor the ſeventh day of the week with all People: ſo cannot the ſix days of the Creation, be the ſame with the ſix days of the week with all People.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The ſeventh day which God Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Sanctified, and Commanded in this Law to be kept holy, was not the day of Gods Reſt. For this cannot any where be known when it beginneth or endeth, and if it ſhould be known, yet all Gods People in all places could not keep the ſame, though they had never fallen by <hi>Adam.</hi> And whether there was or was not an inverſion of the day made as aforeſaid, yet the day of Gods Reſt could not be the ſame day with, the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath: for this they did or might keep from Sun-ſetting to Sun-ſetting, in <hi>Arabia, Jeruſalem, Babylon Rome, Spain, Ophyr,</hi> and in all other places of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode: but the day of Gods Reſt they did not, nor poſſibly could they keep the ſame from Sun-ſetting to ſun-ſetting, in all places where any of them had their abode, unleſs the ſurface of the Earth had been plaid, and not round</p>

But as we according to Gods example, work ſix days, and reſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, ſo did they. As the Sunday with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> was ever the day following their ſix days of labour, ſo was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday with the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath-day was not the day of Gods Reſt, as hath been ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.

That which is expreſſed in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, they and all elſe are ſtill bound to; which is, that having wrought the ſix days of labour, they reſt on the ſeventh day according to Gods example, and keep it holy to the Lord.

               <p>A Week is the ſpace of time made by ſeven whole days without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>By ſeven days, I mean ſeven ſuch days as are all of one and the ſame kind. If any of them be Horizontal days, they are all to be Horizontal days, ſuch as were the ſeven days of the Week with the <hi>Jews.</hi> And if any be Meridio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, they are all to be Meridional days, as are the days of the week with <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath, or ſeventh day was from Sun-ſetting to Sun-ſetting; therefore ſo ſhould the ſix days of their week be alſo. The ſix days of our week are from mid-night to mid-night, and therefore the ſeventh is not to be from Sun-ſetting to Sun ſetting, but from mid-night to mid-night alſo. The ſeventh day muſt relate to the ſix days before-going. The ſeventh day, which was the day of Gods Reſt, cannot relate to the ſix days of work with any People: Nor can the ſeventh day of the week with any People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the ſix days of Gods Work at the Creation; theſe were not of the ſame kind of days with the week-days that now are, or at any time heretofore have been, or can be in uſe with men, as I have already fully proved. <hi>See Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <q>That ſeven whole days without intermiſſion from any time, as from Sunday to Sunday, or from Saturday to Saturday, or from Munday to Munday is a week may appear.</q>
               <p>Firſt, From the ſeveral names and appellations by which a week is called with People of ſeveral Tongues and Languages. Our Antient <hi>Saxons,</hi> and we from them call it Sennight; and two ſuch weeks fortnight; that is, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nights, and fourteen nights. The Romans called it <hi>Septimana;</hi> that is, ſeven mornings, taking the morning for the whole day, as the <hi>Saxons</hi> did the night. With the <hi>Greeks</hi> it was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which is defined to be <hi>Intervallum ſeptem dierum:</hi> That is, ſeven day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> called a week not ſeven nights, as the <hi>Saxons</hi> did, nor ſeven mornings, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did, but as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſeven days, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, a ſeveny of days.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Frequently in Holy Scripture, ſeven days from any ſet time is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152822:29"/> counted a week. <hi>Laban</hi> bade <hi>Jacob fulfill her her week: Gen.</hi> 29.27. meaning the ſeven days of <hi>Leas</hi> Marriage; Such was the uſual time for Marriage-feaſts in thoſe days. <hi>Judg.</hi> 14 10, 12. If a Woman was at any time deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Man-child ſhe was to be unclean ſeven days; or a week: but if ſhe was delivered of a Maid-child, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that is, two weeks: And ſo is it in our laſt Tranſlation. The Lord appointed the <hi>Jews</hi> to count for their feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> called their feaſt of Weeks, thus; <hi>On the morrow after the Firſt-day of the Paſſover</hi> (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fell on the ſame day of the week two years together) ſhalt thou number unto thee ſeven weeks, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.11, 15, 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.9. So that it is evident, that theſe their weeks for meting out unto them their Feaſt of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,</hi> began from different times, or days of their Sabbatical week.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeven days ſo ſucceeding each other, as that their boundary be the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> every indifferent man will grant to be a week. But ſuch may be from any ſet time, or day. Such were the ſeven days of unleavened bread: they began ſometimes on Monday, and ſometimes on Tueſday, and ſometimes on other days, and never two years together on one and the ſame day of the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbatical week. Yet were thoſe ſeven days a week with them, even their week of Sweet Bread; the boundary whereof was the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day. Lev.</hi> 23.8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.16. There is no difference made either in reſpect of Letters, Vowels, or Accents between the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> of the week of ſweet Bread before-ſaid, and the ſeventh day of their Sabbatical week, which with them was the Sabbath-day of the Lord. The like is to be ſaid of the weeks appointed to their Prieſts for their judgment in the caſe of Leproſie, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.5.27. And of the weeks of <hi>Daniels</hi> mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.2, 3. By all which it is clear that a week is ſeven days ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding each other from any ſet time, or day: and that if the firſt day there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be known, the ſeventh day of the ſame will be known alſo.</p>
               <p>Next, We are to know what the ſeventh day of the week is, being the day here in this Law commanded to be kept Holy.</p>
               <p>There is much difference between a ſeventh day and the ſeventh day. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of a week is a ſeventh day; but only the boundary thereof is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of that week. In like manner, there is much difference between the ſeventh day of a week, and the ſeventh day of the week. The ſeventh day from the birth of a Child is the ſeventh day of a week, and the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof; then was the Child a week Old. The laſt day of the week of unleavened-bread was the ſeventh day of a week; and ſo was the ſeventh day appointed to the Prieſt in the caſe of Leproſie, as before was ſhewed; but it was not the ſeventh day of the week, of the week whoſe boundary is Sacred, and Commanded to be kept Holy. This week is the week <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it hath ſome excellency in it, which other weeks have not: and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its Uſe, Conſtancy and Univerſality.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is more excellent than other weeks, in regard of its excellent uſe; which is to meaſure out to men, what days are common, and what are Sacred:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152822:30"/> which are their ſix days in which they may work, &amp; which is the Lords day in which they may not work; according to the Lords own ſtandard held out unto us in this Law. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour &amp;c. But the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> God by this Law tyeth no Nation to a ſet hour, or time when to begin their week: nor by what names they ſhould call the days of their week. But he tyeth all Nations that at what time ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ever they begin the week, they work not on the ſeventh day, but Sanctifie it: It is the Lords. All other weeks are for uſe inferiour to this. Other weeks may for to ſhew the juſt time for payments of monies, weekly or monthly billeting of Souldiers, taking of journeys, and for a thouſand other reckonings in Civil affairs, but all inferiour in uſe unto this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Other weeks are more inconſtant than this, they vary in one and the ſame place, or elſe continue but a ſhort time. The weeks of Sweet Bread varied every year with the <hi>Jews,</hi> like as their Paſſover did, which never fell on the ſame week-day two years together, but were as unconſtant as the Moon. Weeks for payments of moneys, billeting Souldiers, &amp;c. are of ſhort continuance. Of thoſe that do uſe them, ſeldom or never do all of the ſame City or Town begin them at the ſame time; Whereas weeks in uſe for poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the ſeventh day Sacred are conſtant.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Other weeks are not generally in uſe with all. All do not billet by the week, nor pay, nor receive wages by the week, neither do men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally make their reckonings and Accounts by weeks. But weeks for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring out the ſix days of labour, and the ſeventh day Sacred, have been in uſe with all People and Nations of any note and fame, not only with <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations. Though the week was not the ſame with them all, and therefore their ſeventh day Sacred could not be the ſame with all; yet all had ſeven days to the week, and all had the ſeventh day of their week Sacred. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſeventh Sacred day with them called <hi>Algama</hi> is on our <hi>Friday,</hi> becauſe on that day <hi>Mahumet</hi> fled from <hi>Mecha</hi> to <hi>Jethrib</hi>

                  </note>. The <hi>Jews</hi> kept their ſeventh Sacred day on our <hi>Saturday,</hi> beginning the ſame on <hi>Friday</hi> at the ſetting of the Sun, becauſe at that time the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> firſt began their ſix days of gathering Quails and ſuſtenance; as may appear in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. And becauſe at that time of the day their deliverance out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> was aſſured and Sealed unto them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. and alſo for the Lord Commanded them to do ſo. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.32. And <hi>Chriſtians</hi> keep their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sacred on the Sunday, beginning the ſame with the morning; chiefly for that our Lord and Saviour at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> made his glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection on the Sunday morning. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo had the Sunday for their ſeventh Sacred day, though they kept it Sacred in honour of the Sun, of which I ſhall ſay more anon. <hi>See chap.</hi> 15. In theſe reſpects this week may truly be ſaid to be more excellent than all other, and the boundary thereof to be not only the ſeventh day of a week, but the ſeventh day of the week.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> The Antiquity of Weeks proved.</head>
               <p>THE Antiquity of weeks may be gathered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From that it hath been the general practice of moſt Nations, to have juſt ſeven days to the week: and every particular day of the week to bear the name of the ſame Heatheniſh God, or Planet with them all; even with thoſe Nations between whom there was no commerce or traffick; and were unknown the one to the other. How can it be conceived, that many Nations ſhould have neither more nor leſs than ſeven days to the week, and to have the day of the Sun to be Sunday with them all, and the day of the Moon to be Monday with all, and ſo every week-day to be the ſame with them all, (except with the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who only as far as I can read of, altered their week, the <hi>Jew</hi> beginning the ſame on the Sunday, and the <hi>Turk</hi> on the Saturday, for the reaſons before given) had not their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors (before ever they were diſperſed, far from the Land of <hi>Shinar</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria</hi>) under the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, in the time the Planets were held the Gods of the World, ſo counted the week, and called every week-day by the name of the ſame Planet, as now generally we do.</p>
               <p>They who ſhall be alive in <hi>America</hi> three hundred years hence, and ſee there ſo many Notions of different Tongues, and all to have juſt ſeven days to the week, and all to have Sunday for their ſeventh Sacred day and call every of their other week-days alike, will they not ſay or conceive that this could never have ſo happened, had not their Anceſtors in <hi>Europe</hi> obſerved weeks, and had juſt ſo many days to the week, and call every day of the week by the ſame names before ever they removed thence, and were diſperſed into ſo many and various Plantations in <hi>America?</hi> The like may we well conceive of the Antient <hi>Saxons, Romans, Egyptians,</hi> and other Antient Nations, that it could never ſo have happened, that every of them ſhould have weeks, and juſt ſeven days to the week, and every week-day to be called by the name of the ſame Planet with them all, had not their Anceſtors under the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchs, who firſt ſet up the Idolatry of Worſhipping the Planets, obſerved ſeven days to the week, and called the week-days by the ſame names of the Planets, before they came to be Planted abroad in ſeveral Nations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt had no other meaſure to mete out his Age and time, but days and weeks. Theſe be had from the Lords Standard, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wrought ſix days and reſted the ſeventh, did Sanctifie the ſeventh day. <hi>Adam</hi> knew all Creatures at the firſt ſight of them, and gav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> names to the Creatures ſuitable to their Natures. He knew them to be not Eternal, nor a year old, and therefore might as well know their Age to a day. When the Lord brought <hi>Eve</hi> unto him he knew her by ſight. He knew ſhe was not three days, nor a day Old. He knew that ſhe was made of him, and on the ſame ſixth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152822:31"/> day in which he himſelf was made; and that the Lord on the next day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from his Works of Creation. By this Pattern and Standard of the Lord, he might mete out time by weeks before he could have any Experimental knowledge of months and years, which were afterward in time gotten by obſervation of the courſe of the Sun and Moon. And we find, that in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times there was much difference and variation in the count of years and months with People: Some had but three months, ſome ten, the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſometimes twelve, and ſometimes thirteen months to the year. Their months did alſo much differ for length, but never was the week counted to be more or leſs than ſeven days with any People.</p>

                  </note>. This knowledge of the Creation, and of the ſeventh day, and conſequently of the count of days by ſevens or weeks, they could not have but by Tradition, or from the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> From the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> doubtleſs they had it not, for they were not Extant in the Greek Tongue, until <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomie</hi> prevailed to get ſeventy two Seniors of the <hi>Jews</hi> to turn them into Greek, which was many hundred of years after <hi>Homer.</hi> While as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> flouriſhed, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could never get the leaſt parcel of Sacred Scripture.

                  </note> for which ſuppoſed Innovation brought in by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the <hi>Heathen</hi> generally envied them, and their Poets wrote very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully of them about their Sabbath-day. It was not then from <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by Tradition, that they had the knowledge of the Creation and of the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Gomarus,</hi> who with all his might oppoſed the Morality of the Sabbath day, doth yet acknowledge, that <hi>Adam, Methuſelah, Sem</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> had knowledge of the Creation and of the ſeventh day<note n="(c)" place="margin">Gomar. de Sab. p. <hi>113.</hi>
                  </note>; And why not <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, and thouſands beſide them? <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed had a full knowledge by Divine Revelation, and infallible Inſpiration by the Holy Ghoſt, which guided him in the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Relation of the Creation of all things and of the day of Gods Reſt, as well as of other things related in his Books, yet queſtionleſs he had ſome general knowledge by Tradition of moſt things he wrote of, as they were delivered from Father to Son unto his days. It would have been a very wild conceit of <hi>Gomarus</hi> to think, when he wrote that the knowledge of the Creation and of the ſeventh day, came from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> and from him to <hi>Sem,</hi> and from <hi>Sem</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the knowledge there of was intailed to the Heirs Male, or to ſome Perſons in a lineal deſcent from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not to others alſo.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Objection againſt Antiquity of Weeks anſwered. The hourly Government of the Planets is feigned.</head>
               <p>THere may be many who have publiſhed abroad to the World, that there is a certain hourly Rule or Government which the Planets have given them of the Creator, by which every of them ſucceſſively, and in a viciſſitude, doth govern his hour according to this common diſtich,
<q>
                     <l>Cynthia, Mercurius, Venus, &amp; Sol, Mars, Jove, Satur,</l>
                     <l>Ordine retrogrado ſibi quivis vendicat horam.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence they ſay, that untill this hourly Government was by skilful Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers found out and known, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had no weeks, and having no weeks they could not have the ſeventh-day Sacred; ſuppoſing none before this to have week but the <hi>Jews</hi> only, and therefore none but they to have a Sabbath-day.</p>
               <p>Among many other Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> was of this opinion, who from hence doth argue the Sabbath-day not to be moral, being not obſerved or known but by the <hi>Jews</hi> only. He would have us take it for granted, that no Nation without the knowledge of Aſtrology, (the <hi>Jews</hi> excepted) whereby men came firſt to know the Planets hourly Government, and ſo conſequently what Planet governed the firſt hour in every day, could have weeks, or call the week-days by the names of the Planets. <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>following the motion of the Planets, gave to each day the name of that particular Planet, by which the firſt hour of the day was governed as their Aſtrologers had taught them</hi>

All the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Aſtrologers, all the <hi>Magicians</hi> among the <hi>Perſians</hi> he held to be ignorant herein, and therefore during the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy weeks not to be in uſe.

                  </note>. But he holds that they (being ignorant of the Scriptures) could not have weeks before they had gotten this knowledge by the motions of the Planets. And from hence concludeth, <hi>that the</hi> Chaldees, Perſians, Greeks <hi>and</hi> Romans, <hi>all the four great Monarchies did obſerve no Sabbaths, becauſe they did obſerve no weeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer hereunto I ſay, that if it be true which the Doctor would, that without the Holy Scripture, weeks could not be known but by the knowledge of the ſaid hourly government of the Planets; and that this government of the Planets was not found till the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of late times, and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> from them had gotten the knowledge thereof; it muſt needs be confeſſed, not only what the Doctor thence inferreth, that all the four great Monarchies did obſerve no Sabbath, becauſe they did obſerve no weeks. But that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Flood, and all Nations, and People whatſoever (the <hi>Jews</hi> only excepted) were without a Sabbath-day, and could not have the ſeventh-day Sacred with any of them, till about the time of <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who was <hi>Plato</hi>'s Schollar, becauſe they neither had nor could have weeks before.</p>
               <p>But for anſwer in plain terms: It is very untrue what the Dr. alledgeth. There was never any ſuch hourly government of the Planets found out, but feigned. Neither had the week-days their names firſt from the Planets governing the firſt hour of the day. Both which I will clear and make apparent.</p>
               <p>Touching the former; There is no ſuch hourly government found out in deed and truth; but there hath ſuch an one feigned to be; and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a new order, or ſituation of the Planets made by Aſtronomers in later times.</p>

                  </note> Feigning the week-days to anſwer the ſuppoſed harmony of the Spheres; every fourth Planet in that order perpetually to ſound out the name of the next ſucceeding day. The other was this hourly government before-ſaid, firſt brought to light in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as is ſuppoſed; by which it will ſo fall out, that let every Planet be ſuppoſed to govern his hour ſucceſſively according to this new order, it will ſo fall out that the Planet which ſhall come to rule the firſt hour of the next day, will be the very ſame whoſe name that day doth bear. Both theſe I confeſs, are very witty: but a meer fancy. And they, who urge from hence, that the Planets have ſuch an hourly rule, and government given them by their Creator, by which every one in ſeven days doth conſtantly, and by courſe, Rule the firſt hour of a week-day, and that thereby men came to have ſeven days to the week, and to call the days of the week by the names of the Planets orderly, as they came to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the firſt hour of the day, are meerly deluded. For had there been in truth ſuch an hourly government given them, and had they exerciſed the ſame; then ſure,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have gotten this knowledge before all men. And then it would follow hence, that men had weeks from the beginning, even from this hourly Rule of the Planets: but indeed, <hi>Adam</hi> had better ground for weeks, than the Planets could afford; which was Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix days and reſting the ſeventh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>Adam</hi> had not known this rarity, or if he had known it, and would reveal it to none of his Children; Yet the Aſtrologers before the Flood would doubtleſs have found out the ſame: they were moſt excellent in the knowledge of Aſtrology, as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and many other in their Writings tell
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152822:34"/> us; they had ſuch experiments in, and of their obſervations, which men in future times, living not the tenth of their days, could never attain unto. Doubtleſs had there been ſuch a Rule indeed, they would have known it; and alſo written this rarity in thoſe Pillars <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth<note n="(a)" place="margin">Joſep.

                  </note>, that future Ages might not be ignorant thereof. Surely thoſe long-liv'd Aſtrologers deſerved not to be of that name and fame, if ignorant of the ſaid hourly government of the Planets, had there been any ſuch Rule, or Government then in being.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be ſuppoſed, that none before the Flood were ſuch excellent Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers; yet the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> whoſe Religion was in adoring the Hoſt of Heaven, and in ſearching after the motions and effects of the Planets, who beſtowed their whole time therein, even from their Childhood: who inſtructed their little Children in the knowledge of the Stars<note n="(b)" place="margin">Boemus ubi de Aſſyria.</note>, as we teach Children the Catechiſm; theſe I ſay of all other ſince the Flood, ſhould have been the finders out of this Rule and Government of the Planets had there been any ſuch among them. A vanity is it to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that ſuch an excellency ſhould be kept ſecret from the Creation during thouſand of years, and not found out till late times, by ſome <hi>Egyptians</hi> of no Note or Name; whereas the diſcoverers thereof (had there been ſuch a thing indeed found out) deſerved to have their names Ingraven in Marble for their laſting memory to all ſucceeding Ages.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If this hourly Government be really true, then there can but one Planet govern the firſt hour of one and the ſame day, at one and the ſame place; and which ſhall give name to that day; if otherwiſe, then this hourly rule is not ſound, but feigned. Now we know, that one and the ſame day at one and the ſame place, may be <hi>Friday, Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> to ſeveral perſons. I will clear this in Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> own words.</p>

It will fall out, that the</hi> Turk <hi>by going VVeſtward, having loſt a day; and the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>going Eaſtward, having got a day; one and the ſelf ſame day will be a</hi> Friday <hi>to the</hi> Turk, <hi>a</hi> Saturday <hi>to the</hi> Jew, <hi>and a</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>to the</hi> Chriſtian. Sith then one and the ſame day came to be a <hi>Friday,</hi> a <hi>Saturday,</hi> and a <hi>Sunday</hi> unto theſe three by their Travel, there muſt be three ſeveral Planets to govern the firſt hour of that day; or elſe the Planets muſt by little and little have gotten and loſt a whole courſe of governing, as the Travellers did by little and little gain and loſe a whole day by their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; both which will ſhew this hourly rule of the Planets to be both vain and feigned.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:152822:34"/>
               <p>Touching the latter, that week-days had not their names from the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed hourly rule of the Planets, may from theſe reaſons be gathered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This hourly rule doth flow from the names of the week-days, and not the week-day names from it. Men muſt firſt know by what Planets name the day is called, before they can tell what Planet muſt govern the firſt hour thereof. For ſuppoſe the two Travellers before-ſaid, the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and the <hi>Turk,</hi> had met at any place before they had ended their journey: it muſt be as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath demonſtrated the like <hi>(a),</hi> Sunday then with the <hi>Turk,</hi>

Now let the moſt skilful of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger be demanded, what day it ſhould be unto them both, either Saturday or Sunday? whether the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Saturn</hi> ruled the firſt hour thereof? He will anſwer as the <hi>Chaldees</hi> did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, There is not a man upon the earth that can ſhew this matter, Dan.</hi> 2.10. Yea though the place where thoſe Travellers met were made known alſo, yet would the queſtion remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolvable, unleſs there be ſome line or other ſuppoſed, where the Planets ſhould begin their Government, and from whence the Calculation is to be made: But in that ſuppoſal there is no certainty. Now if the ſaid Travellers agree together, to have that day of their meeting to be Sunday, then any Aſtrologer will readily tell them, that the <hi>Sun</hi> was he that ruled the firſt hour thereof: or if they make it Saturday, then <hi>Saturn</hi> was he. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the week-days muſt be known, before men can know the ſaid planetary Rule and Government. I would not have any conceive, that by the Planetary Rule and Government, I ſhould mean here that Government and Lordſhip, which the Planets are of old ſaid to have in their own Home and Houſes; it is the hourly Rule of the Planets, mentioned in the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I mean. I confeſs my ſelf to be but little skill'd in the one; but this he that hath but the uſe of a pair of Globes may demonſtrate to be falſe, and to have no truth in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Germans</hi> had weeks, and called the week-days by the names of their Gods whom they adored, which were the ſeven Planets, and this long before they came to have any knowledge of this hourly Rule of the Planets, which <hi>Henricus Haſſianus</hi> got in <hi>Paris,</hi> and then after taught the ſame in <hi>Vienna:</hi> and that not yet four hundred years ſince. The Doctor ſaith, <hi>That the</hi> Grecians <hi>had not weeks till</hi> Eudoxus <hi>had taught them this excellency in Aſtrology, which he brought from</hi> Egypt <hi>a little before; he might with as much truth have ſaid, that the</hi> Germans <hi>had not weeks, till</hi> Henricus Haſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>had taught this knowledge in Aſtrology, which he brought from</hi> Paris <hi>a little before.</hi> There is the ſame reaſon in them both, but this is known to be far from truth. If any ſay that the <hi>Germans</hi> had learnt to have weeks, and to call the days of the week by the names of the Planets, ſince the ſaid hourly Rule was found out, and that either from the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Grecians,</hi> or from ſome other Nation with whom they lived, before they came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit in <hi>Germany:</hi> as the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and other People

The <hi>Germans</hi> were a Nation and a Kingdom before <hi>Eudoxus</hi> knew what a Planet was. <hi>Verſtegan</hi> alſo tells us, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> had in Antient times the ſeven Planets for their Gods, whom they called <hi>Son, Mone, Tuiſco, &amp;c.</hi> and alſo called the days of the week by the names of thoſe their Gods, before ever they had any Commerce with the <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> either.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Week-days bear the names of the Planets, not from the ſaid late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented hourly Rule, ſuppoſed to be given them by God, when he Created them, but as they were the <hi>Heathens</hi> Gods, and were orderly Worſhipped and Adored by them. Thus the day we call Sunday, was by the <hi>Heathen</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called the day of the Sun, becauſe of all the Planets who were held to be the Lords and Governours of the World; he was that Lord and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour which had ſpecial Worſhip done unto him on that day, and for that his Worſhip began with that days beginning, even at the Sun-riſing (for at that time did the <hi>Heathen</hi> begin their Worſhip to the Sun, and to every of the reſt of the Hoſt of Heaven, as I have ſhewed before,) which was the firſt hour of the day with them; he hath been ſaid and held, to begin his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Government on the beginning, or firſt hour of that day; and hence is it that that day was by the Antient Heathen called the day of the Sun: the like may be ſaid of the other names of the week-days.</p>
               <p>That the week-days were by the Heathens called by the names of the Planets, as they were the <hi>Heathens</hi> Gods adored by them, is evident, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Teſtimonies of ſundry Learned men, but alſo from Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi>

               <p>HAving declared what weeks are, and the long continuance of them; and alſo anſwered the main objection made againſt their Antiquity; I will now indeavour to make apparent, that Sunday was not only a ſeventh, but the ſeventh day with the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which it hath already been proved, 1. That the ſeven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets were of the old <hi>Gentiles</hi> Gods. 2. That the ſeven days of the week were deputed to thoſe their Gods; and as <hi>John Gregory</hi> doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us<note n="(a)" place="margin">Jo. Greg. in his Aſſyrian Monarchy.</note> in his <hi>Aſſyrians Monarchy,</hi> that the days of the week were called of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> by the names of the ſame Planets, unto whom the week-days were ſeverally dedicated; and that all Nations did from them call the days of the week in like manner. 3. That the Sun was of all their Gods held the Chiefeſt and Supream.</p>
               <p>Now common ſenſe and reaſon will tell us, that the day which was by them Dedicated to their Chiefeſt God, and bare his Name; the day of the Sun, which we call Sunday, muſt be with them the chiefeſt day of all the ſeven in their eſtimation; and therefore was it with them not only a ſeventh day of the week, but the ſeventh day <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Neither was Sunday the ſeventh day of the week with the Idolatrous <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> only, but was alſo, as it is moſt probable, that ſeventh day which the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Flood held to the Honour of the Creator, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Creation, and of Gods Reſting on the ſeventh day. For when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152822:36"/> 
                  <hi>Nimrod</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Saturnus Babylonicus, Belus</hi> his Son, and other Potentates of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> had Idolatrouſly ſet up the whole Hoſt of Heaven, that is, the Sun, Moon, and the other Planets, with conſtellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſubſervient to them; which of the ſeven days of the week, will any reaſonable man imagine, did they dedicate to the Honour of their greateſt God the Sun, rather than that, which before was held to the Honour of God the Creator? Surely not any other. And when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi> Powers had, as much as in them lay, robbed God (if I may ſo ſay) of his Titles, Attributes, Providence, Works of Creation, Government and Worſhip; and gave the chief of all their ſpoils to their chiefeſt God the Sun; <hi>Nimrod</hi> giving him the name <hi>Baal</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Jo. Greg. Aſſyr. Monar.</note>, which he afterwards aſſumed to himſelf<note n="(b)" place="margin">Biblian.</note>, <hi>Belus</hi> giving him the name <hi>Jove, (Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) the which he aſſumed afterward unto himſelf, and was called <hi>Jove Bel.</hi> They called the Sun God, and held him the God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, and Governour of all things: and that the World was not Created, but was from everlaſting govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Planets, the Sun being Chief and Soveraign Ruler: Would they not do the like, may any one think, with that day which was held to the Honour of the Creator? All that, was known to be for the Worſhip and Honour of God the Creator, they gave to the Honour of the Sun; and therefore doubtleſs they deputed to the Sun that day alſo.</p>
               <p>Again, When they aſſigned to every of thoſe Gods the ſeveral days of the week, no indifferent underſtanding man but will conceive that they would Dedicate to their greateſt God the Sun, the day held before to the Honour of the great God of Heaven and Earth, rather than to the <hi>Moon, Mercury,</hi> or other inferior Gods. So that moſt likely, the ſeventh day with the <hi>Patriarks,</hi> was none other, but that which afterwards was the Suns day with the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and from them was called the day of the Sun with other Nations alſo, as the other week-days were called by the names of the other Planets: and ſo by cuſtom have they continued to be called with all Nations of any note for Civility and Knowledge, except with the <hi>Jews</hi> only, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had another day aſſigned unto them for their ſeventh Sacred day; and had a ſpecial Command given them, not to make any mention of thoſe Gods of the Nations, nor to have their names at all in their mouth, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sunday was the ſeventh day of the week with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as may be Collected from the Pens of many Learned Authors, as well <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as <hi>Heathen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aug. Steuchius in Gen.</hi> 2. Speaking of the ſeventh day affirmed, that it was <hi>in omni aetate inter omnes gentes venerabilis &amp; ſacer.</hi> The like do <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Beda,</hi> and other more, whoſe words I have before in the 13. Chapter expreſſed; Alſo amongſt the moſt Antient Poets, divers of them do teſtifie the ſame, as <hi>Linus, Callimachus, Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> who was above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before <hi>Eudoxus</hi> knew what Aſtrology was. All of them were
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152822:37"/> 
                  <hi>Heathen,</hi> yet all of them ſpake very laudably of the ſeventh Sacred day. Their words for brevities ſake I will not here rehearſe, ſith they are to be ſeen, and are urged by many Writers, as namely, <hi>Clem. Alexand. Strom. l.</hi> 5. <hi>Euſeb. de Praep. Evang. l.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>Rivetus in Gen. c.</hi> 2. and in his <hi>Diſſert. de Origine Sabba.</hi> Alſo Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Sabbath, part</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. Now the ſeventh day ſo laudably by them ſpoken of, was the day of the Sun. For, 1. It was not Saturday the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeventh day. The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> liked the <hi>Jews</hi> Saturday, as (ſaid a Papiſt) the Devil doth Holy-water. It was counted by them a diſdainful novelty; their Poets commonly would have one laſh or other at the <hi>Jews</hi> for it, and never ſpake in honour thereof. 2. The Adverſaries themſelves do grant that the day of the Sun was the ſeventh day, and Sacred alſo with the <hi>Heathen;</hi> but here's their evaſion, <hi>The ſeventh day Sacred to the Sun with the Heathen,</hi> ſay they, <hi>was the ſeventh day of the Month, and not the ſeventh day of the week.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the day of the Sun was the ſeventh day of the week with the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and not the ſeventh day of the month, thus I prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> both alledge the ſaid Poets, to ſhew that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had the ſeventh day of the week Sacred with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Other Authors generally take Sunday with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for a week-day, and not for the day of a month.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Had the ſeventh day Sacred to the Sun been the ſeventh day of every month, as they affirm, the <hi>Greeks</hi> doubtleſs would have noted the ſame down in their Calenders. Though they could not ſet down conſtantly the ſeventh day of the week, by reaſon of their intercaling ſo many days at a time, no more than others then could do; and no more than we can ſet down the moveable Feaſts that were with us, unleſs it be in a yearly Almanack, before that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> had corrected the year. Yet never ſhall we ſee a Calender, in which the Principal immovable Sacred days were omitted. Now there is an Antient <hi>Attick</hi> Calendar to be ſeen in <hi>Scaliger de emend. temp.</hi> wherein things of leſs conſequence are noted; but this ſeventh day Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to the Sun in each month cannot be found.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Dr. <hi>Francis White</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> alſo tell us<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>White</hi> of the Sabbath p. <hi>197. Heyl.</hi> par. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>53.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the firſt Ages, becauſe they kept the Sunday for their Sacred Services, and bowed Eaſtward in their Worſhip, were upbraided for Sun-Worſhippers, though they neither Worſhipped the Sun, nor called their day of Worſhipping God Sunday, but the Lords day, being their Sabbath Sacred day of Reſt to the Lord. Surely if Sunday had not been with the <hi>Heathen</hi> who were Sun Worſhippers indeed, a weekly ſervice day, but the ſeventh day of the month only, there had been no cauſe or ground, why either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> ſhould have caſt ſuch an aſperſion on them of being Worſhippers of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This may further appear by the decree of Pope <hi>Milchiades,</hi> whom ſome call <hi>Miltiades,</hi> the laſt of all the Popes that were Martyrs. He to make a clear difference between the obſervation of Sunday by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152822:37"/> obſervation of Sunday by the <hi>Heathen,</hi> ordained that all <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were converted and were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſhould not faſt on the Sundays nor on Thurſdays, as the other <hi>Gentiles</hi> did. Note, that as Wedneſday, Friday and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, were now in late times called Sacred or Prayer-days; ſo were Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Sunday in old times; on which days they filled not themſelves as on other days till their Sacred Services were ended. The decree <hi>Sever. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> on the Life of the ſaid Pope ſets down thus: <hi>Jejunium verò Dominici diei, &amp; quintae feriae nemo celebrare debet; ut inter jejunium Chriſtianorum, &amp; Gentilium veraciter, &amp;c.</hi> He would not that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould faſt on the Thurſday, and on the Lords day, called by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Sunday, that ſo there might be an open and apparent diſtinction between <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Heathen</hi> in the obſervation of thoſe days. From which time till of late, our Tables have teſtified obedience to that decree, being uſually furniſhed with more variety of Diſhes on the Sundays and Thurſdays, than on any day of the week beſides. If any one here ſay, that theſe days were not Sacred but Faſting days, becauſe <hi>Binius</hi> call them <hi>jejunia;</hi> I would have him inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Sacred days were with the <hi>Heathen</hi> called Faſts, becauſe they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from feeding themſelves till their Services were ended: the like did the <hi>Jews,</hi> yea and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> too in old time. <hi>Trogus</hi> Writing the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he would tell us that <hi>Moſes</hi> ordained the Saturday, being the ſeventh day with the <hi>Jews,</hi> to be a Sacred day perpetually, he thus expreſſeth the ſame. <hi>Septimum diem more Gentis Sabbatum appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum, in omne aevum jejunio ſacravit</hi> Moſes<note n="(a)" place="margin">Trog. li. <hi>36.</hi>
                  </note>. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> ſheweth plentifully that the <hi>Heathen</hi> Poets, and others called Sacred days Faſting days<note n="(b)" place="margin">Heyl. part <hi>1.</hi> page <hi>102.</hi>
                  </note>. But to put us out of doubt that the Thurſday, and Sunday were not only faſting days, but Sacred alſo with the Heathen, <hi>Platina</hi> reſolveth the caſe: who, on the Life of the ſaid Pope, ſets down his Decree thus. <hi>Miltiadis inſtitutum fuit, né Dominico, neve feriâ quintâ jejunaretur; quia hos dies Pagani quaſi ſacros ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrant.</hi> Whereby it appears, that Sunday was a Sacred day, not of the month, but of the week with the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, The Teſtimonies of divers Learned Writers ſhew that the day of the Sun with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a week-day, even the ſame which we call the Lords day.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It ſeemeth by theſe that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at firſt, deveſted the Sun of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip given him on the day of the Sun, and gave the whole right of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip on that day unto the Lord God. They ſerved the day of the Sun as the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to ſerve their Captive Maidens; the things that grew excrementitiouſly on them, as hair, and nails were to be ſhaven, and cut; <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.12. and ſo caſt away, &amp;c. and then the men lawfully might keep and uſe them: So <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the firſt Age after Chriſts Aſcenſion, pared off, and caſt away what did excrementitiouſly (if I may ſo ſay) grow on the day of the Sun, as the Adoration, and Superſtitious Services given to it on that day; and then they lawfully might, and did make uſe of the ſame; and it became their ſtanding ſervice-day unto Gods honour.</p>
               <p>Divers other Teſtimonies of ſundry Authors may be given to prove the day of the Sun with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be, not their ſeventh day of the month, but the ſeventh day of the week; all which I here omit: only I referr the Reader for his further ſatisfaction to Doctor <hi>Heylins.</hi> Hiſtory of the Sabbath<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heyl par.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 53, 61, 62, 63.</note>, wherein he ſheweth that not only the days of the Moon, of <hi>Mars,</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were the ſame which we call Munday, Tueſday, Wedneſday, &amp;c. But alſo that the day of the Sun is the ſame which we call Sunday, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame out of <hi>Tertullian, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here it may be demanded, that ſith the Sunday was the day Sacred with the Heathen, Dedicated to the Sun, and to the diſhonour of God ſo much abuſed by their Heatheniſh Superſtition, and Idolatry: Whether <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Apoſtles time, or afterward ſhould not have done well to have choſen Friday, or Saturday, or ſome other day for their ſtanding day of the week for Gods ſervice rather then the Sunday?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> To alter or change the Sabbath from the ſeventh day, and to make it the eighth, ninth, ſixth, or any other than the ſeventh, which is the laſt day of the week, is againſt the expreſs Law of God, as before hath hath been ſhewed, though it be no where forbidden to alter the whole week by beginning the ſame ſooner, or later.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They lawfully might, and did alter and change both the name, and alſo the Worſhip, or ſervice done on that day; for they called it no longer Sunday unleſs in their common talk with the <hi>Heathen,</hi> but they called it the Lords day; being the day which the Lord in this Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152822:38"/> to be Sanctifyed; Neither did they adore, and Worſhip the Sun any more on that day, but the Lord their Creator and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is true that all the week-days were abuſed to the Idolatrous Worſhip of the Planets, though not in the like degree as was the Sunday: And that one day, in it ſelf, was no more holy than another; Yet <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſhould not have done well in changing, or in their endeavouring to have changed their ſtanding ſervice day, from Sunday to any other day of the week; and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the contempt, ſcorn and deriſion they thereby ſhould be had in among all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with whom they lived; and toward whom they ought by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule to live inoffenſively 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. in things indifferent. If the <hi>Gentiles</hi> thought hardly, and ſpake evil of them, for that they <hi>ran not into the ſame exceſs of riot with them:</hi> 1. Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 4.4. what would they have ſaid of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for ſuch an Innovation as would have been made by their change of their ſtanding ſervice-day? If long before this, the <hi>Jews</hi> were had in ſuch diſdain among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for their Saturday-Sabbath (which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> held to be a ſingularity, and innovation brought in by <hi>Moſes</hi>) inſomuch that <hi>Jeremy</hi> lamenteth the ſame, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.7. How grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous would be their Taunts and reproaches againſt the poor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> living with them, and under their power, for their new ſet Sacred day, had the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> choſen any other than the Sunday? Had Sr. <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and Captain <hi>Cavendiſe,</hi> and their companies, who Travelled round the Earth with them, either out of tenderneſs of Conſcience, or elſe out of obſtinacy continued to keep that Sunday Sacred which fell to them by courſe, and true tale of the days ſucceeding each other: they muſt needs have had their Sunday on our Munday, and our Sunday would be their Saturday: When it was holy day with them, it would be working day with us; and holy day with us when they would work. So <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Jews, Profana illic quae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud nos ſacra, rurſum conceſſa, quae nobis illicita</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Corn. Tacit. Diurnal. li. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note>. Now how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, may any one imagine ſhould thoſe Travellers have lived among us, as long as our Sunday was a week-day with them? Would not every Ballad-maker have had them in their Rimes? Would they not have been a by-word with all? and every Apparator would be ready with a Citation for them. And can we conceive that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at firſt ſhould find more favour from the <hi>Heathen</hi> for their wilfulneſs which was leſs excuſeable?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then were either Servants or of the poorer ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (moſt probably) would not give their ſervants liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ceaſe from working on any other ſet day conſtantly, except on their Sunday.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Had they changed their ſeventh day from their Sunday to another day, there muſt have followed an unſufferable confuſion in the count of the week-days with whom they lived, as for example: had Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and his company obſerved at his return, the weeks which by his exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152822:39"/> fell to them by courſe; and not have changed them, and made them the ſame with our weeks, there would have followed a miſerable confuſion even in their own families. The third day of the week with ſome muſt have been the fourth with others of the ſame family. And never a day would have been the ſame with them all. The like would it have been with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> with whom they lived, if they had changed their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth ſtanding day for Gods Worſhip (which was Sunday) for another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe had they aſſayed ſuch a change, it would have been a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt them of ſlighting the Glorious Reſurrection of our Lord and Saviour, <hi>The Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Mal. 4.2. who on the Sunday moſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly Roſe from the Dead for the Juſtification of all his People.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It would have been but labour in vain for them to have aſſayed the ſame, they could never have brought it to paſs. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They had no authoritative ſpecification of any ſet day either by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, or by his Apoſtles, on which they ought to keep the Lords day. Had there ſo been, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have preſt the indifferency of days, as he did, <hi>Rom,</hi> 14.1, 2, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. nor would he himſelf have with the believing <hi>Jews</hi> kept the Saturday, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.14, 42.17, 2, 18.4. and with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> I mean the <hi>Gentiles</hi> converted to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>) have kept the Sunday, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. neither would the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Jews</hi> have remained ſo obſtinate, but would have kept that day for their Sabbath, which was ſo pointed out unto them, if there had been ſuch: Whereas they for the generality of them, would never be withdrawn to keep any other than their Saturday for their Sabbath, hundreds of years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtles days.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They had no coercive Power to draw refuſers to the obſervation of any other day for the Lords day, had they been ſo diſpoſed to have ſet any other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were not all of one City, or of one Countrey, or of one Nation, Tongue or Government. It would have been even a miracle to have gotten all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all parts of the World to have obſerved one and the ſame day for the Lords day with them all, which ſhould be choſen, not by a general meeting, or by a general conſent, but by ſome of them only, had they choſen any other than the day of the Sun, which they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally before their Converſion accuſtomed to keep. The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were but one Nation, all of one Tongue, and ſevered from all other People, and alſo had <hi>Moſes</hi> their Captain-General: yet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould never have withdrawn them from their old accuſtomed day, to the obſervation of the Saturday-Sabbath, different from the cuſtom of all other Nations, had not the Lord God miraculouſly in the fall of Quails and Manna, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.12, 16, 22, 23, 26. ſhewed that it was his good pleaſure ſo to have it, when he aſſigned unto them their ſix days for their labour, and ſo pointing out to them the Saturday, being the ſeventh from their firſt gathering Quails and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, to be the day of Holy Reſt unto the Lord. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the firſt Pope of that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152822:39"/> name, when out of his hatred to the memory of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Gods, he would have changed but the names of the week-days, decreed them to be called by the names of <hi>Feriae,</hi> as hath been before ſhewed; though he was of great Authority and Command, and highly beloved of the People; yet he could not prevail herein, but with very few except Schollars; the vulgar People in their common talk, called their week days as they did before, by the names of the Planets; and ſo have they continued to call them, even to this day. The <hi>Jews</hi> are now a weak People, yet there is not a Prince or Power on earth able to withdraw them from their Superſtitious Cuſtom of keeping the Saturday Sacred; yea the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> as was ſhewed, in the Apoſtles time, and in many years after, could not be won by any means that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might uſe, to give over their Saturday-Sabbath, and for Unities ſake to keep the Lords day on the Sunday, except a very few of them who better knew and acknowledged their liberty by Chriſt. How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible may we then think it to be for any to bring to paſs, that all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all quarters of the World, ſhould leave off their obſerving the Sunday Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and have another day inſtead thereof? In vain therefore would it have been for poor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at firſt to have aſſayed the ſame.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons, if there were no more, may ſuffice to ſhew, that although all days be in themſelves indifferent: yet <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould not have well done, had they endeavoured to have changed their ſeventh Sacred day, from Sunday to any other week-day; no not to Thurſday, though it was the day of Chriſt his glorious Aſcenſion; nor to Friday, though it was the day in which Chriſt paid our Ranſom: but better to retain the ſame day as they did; and which the Church of Chriſt hath ſince that kept, even to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and by Gods Grace will ſo do unto the end.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> The Sabbath-day is to be ſanctified. Works of Piety, Government, and of Nature only are to be done on the Sabbath-day, &amp;c. the neceſſary helps thereunto.</head>
               <p>THere hath been before ſhewed, that the Sabbath day in this Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be kept holy, is not a part of a day as is the Artificial day, but an whole day. And that it is not ſuch a kind of day as are the days of the Creation mentioned in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> but ſuch a kind of day, as is or hath been in uſe with men. And alſo that it is not in tale, the fifth, ſixth, eighth, or ninth day, but the ſeventh, not the ſeventh day of the month, but the ſeventh day of the week, the day following the ſix known days of labour, where men dwell and inhabit. Which day with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is vulgarly called Sunday, otherwiſe more fitly, and as indeed it is, <hi>The Lords day,</hi> even our Sabbath-day to the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:152822:40"/>
               <p>Now in the next place is to be ſhewed how the Lords day is to be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. To the ſanctification of the Sabbath-day of the Lord, which we call the Lords day, two things are required.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That we keep it a day of reſt.</item>
                  <item>2. That we Sanctifie that time of reſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That we are to keep it a day of reſt the Scripture fully ſheweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the ſeventh day thou ſhalt reſt, in Earing time and in Harveſt,</hi> Exod. 34.21. The like have we in divers other places of Scripture, calling it a day of reſt.</p>
               <p>All men are to ceaſe from the works of their calling, which on other days they lawfully may, yea and ought to do for the maintenance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs. <hi>Six days ſhall work be done, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of reſt, ye ſhall do no work therein.</hi> Lev. 23.3, So are the words here in this Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do any work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas we are here forbidden to do any work, we muſt not ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words, as if on the Sabbath-day we ſhould reſt from all kind and manner of works, and ſo do no work at all upon that day, the words of the Text do not bear ſuch a ſenſe.

                  <hi>in the plural, for Arts, and Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> So <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> alſo correcteth <hi>Pagnines</hi> Tranſlation of the Bible, that whereas <hi>Pagnine</hi> hath it, <hi>Non facies omne opus,</hi> he turneth it, <hi>Non facies omnem functionem,</hi> Deut. 5.14. where <hi>Pagnine</hi> Tranſlateth thus, <hi>Omnis qui fecerit in eo opus, &amp;c. Montanus</hi> hath it, <hi>Omnis faciens in eo functionem,</hi> Exod. 35.2. Where <hi>Pagnine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omnis faciens opus in die Sabbati:</hi> it is thus to be read according to <hi>Montanus, Omnis faciens opificium in the die ceſſationis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.15. The like may be ſeen in divers other places of Scripture, ſo Tranſlated by the one, and ſo Corrected by the other. Whence we may gather that the true meaning of theſe words commonly read in our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do any work:</hi> is not that we ſhould do no manner of work at all; but that we ſhould do on the Sabbath-day no manner of the works of our Trade, Function and Occupation. The Smith is not to work at his Anvil, nor the Shoomaker with his Awl, nor any other about any works that belong to mens Trade and Profeſſion, which on the ſix days of labour they may and ſhould do for getting their maintenance and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood.</p>
               <p>There be ſome other works which on every day may lawfully be done, even on the Sabbath-day it ſelf without the leaſt breach of this Law, and they are of three ſorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Works of Piety.</item>
                  <item>2. Works of Government towards the Creature ſubjected to us.</item>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:152822:40"/>
                  <item>3. Works needful to the preſervation of mans life.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe works may be done one every day without any violation of the Law of the Sabbath. Neither doth the Law of the Sabbath abridge us from doing them on any day.</p>
               <p>What God ordained before ever the ſeventh day was in being, was not, and is not nulled or abridged by the Law of the Sabbath, but theſe works were before ordained by the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Man was made and had his being to ſerve God, to Honour and Worſhip him, to perform duties of Piety, in ſuch manner as he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him. The doing of theſe duties on the Sabbath-day doth no Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Law of the Sabbath. Men doing them may be ſaid to break or profane the Sabbath; yet not break the Law of the Sabb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th. When we have been diligent on the Sabbath-day in doing ſervice unto God, and the duties he requireth of us for his Honour, we may therein be ſaid not to make the day a day of reſt, but to break the reſt or Sabbath; yet not to break the Commandment by doing theſe works. Thus Chriſt told the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that the Prieſts in the Temple did profane the Sabbath and are blameleſs. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.5. Sure they could not be ſaid to be blameleſs, had they by their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Bullocks or Sheep broken the Commandment; they brake the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, they made it not a day of reſt from theſe works, and ſo were ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it, that is, in reſpect of theſe labours they made it common with other days; all days being alike Lawful or common for doing works of Piety.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Works of Government of the Creatures ſubjected unto man, were ordained of the Lord before man was made. <hi>Let us make man</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>in our Image after our likeneſs, and let them have dominion over, &amp;c. Gen.</hi> 1.26, 28. and when God had made man, he commanded them to have Dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, over the Foul, over Cattle, and over every living thing upon the Earth. This Law and Ordinance was not repealed or nulled by any ſucceeding Law. Man is to exerciſe this his Rule and Government committed unto him on any day. If fire ſhould threaten to deſtroy a houſe or houſes, Corn, or ſuch like on the Sabbath-day, man is as well bound to uſe his power in ſuppreſſing the ſame on the Sabbath-day as on any other. If Water indanger drowning of Cattle, or if Cattle ſtrive together, whereby ſome are like to periſh, and man do not ſuccour and ſeek to preſerve what was in danger, becauſe it was on the Sabbath day, he ſheweth himſelf to be a bad Governour of the Creature; or if he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Sheep or other Cattle to periſh for want of Foddering, Folding, or Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, as need requireth, he is not worthy to have the Government of Cattle.</p>
               <p>The like I ſay, concerning works needful for the preſervation of mans life. When <hi>Adam</hi> was in the ſtate of Innocency, before ever the ſeventh day was, even on the day of his Creation, the Lord ordained him food. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have given you,</hi> ſaid God, <hi>every herb bearing ſeed,</hi> (ſome whereof
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152822:41"/> were Phyſical) <hi>which is upon the face of all the Earth: and every Tree in which is the fruit of a Tree yielding ſeed, to you it ſhall be for meat,</hi> Gen. 1.29. It was Gods will and Ordinance that man being made a living ſoul ſhould uſe the means for the preſervation of his life. And this his Ordinance, was never repealed by any ſucceeding Law. All theſe three kind of works may be done on the Sabbath-day as well as on other days; always provided that there be no irregularity in performing them. We muſt have regard to neceſſity requiring preſent help; when this giveth way, the duties more excellent are more eſpecially to be regarded. And as theſe works may be done on the Lords day, ſo may the neceſſary helps thereunto be then done alſo. A man may on the Sabbath-day Travel on foot to the meeting place, and aſſembly of Gods People; and if he cannot well go on foot he may ride. Alſo as men may feed, fold or houſe their Cattle on the Lords day, ſo may they uſe the neceſſary helps thereunto, which could not be done the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And ſo alſo may they not only eat, drink, ſleep, and take Phyſick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as need requireth, but alſo may uſe needful helps thereunto; as heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their meat, and ſuch like; for all ſtomacks cannot feed on cold meat. But let all take heed leſt under a pretence of neceſſity, he robs God of his due Honour, and his Conſcience of true Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here ſome will object, <hi>that this Commandment tyed the</hi> J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ws <hi>from kindling any fire on their Sabbath-day.</hi> If then we are bound to keep this Law as ſtrictly as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, we ought not to kindle fire at all upon the Sabbath-day for any occaſion whatſoever, though for ſaving ones life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> To which I anſwer: that this precept in <hi>Exodus</hi> the five and thirtieth Chapter, and third Verſe, forbade the <hi>Jews</hi> not from making any fire at all, whether it be a help towards the duties of piety, or mens health and ſafety: But from making fire, whereby it ſhould be a help towards their Trades, Occupations or Functions which are expreſly forbidden to be done in this Commandment on the Sabbath day. And that this is the meaning may appear, for that,</p>
               <p>Firſt, This precept hath an eye, and reflecteth on the words immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going before in the former Verſe, in which is a rehearſal of the ſumm of this fourth Commandment. In theſe words, according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Arias Monta.</note> 
                  <hi>Six days ſhall Function</hi> (Occupation or Trade) <hi>be done, and in the ſeventh there ſhall be to you holineſs, a reſt of ceſſation to the Lord, every one doing his Function in that day ſhall die.</hi> Then immediately followeth, <hi>There ſhall no fire be kindled in all your habitations in the day of ceſſation.</hi> The works about mens perſonal callings, and functions for getting wealth being forbidden in the former Verſe; in this is forbidden the means tending thereto, as the kindling of fire. And haply kindling fire is here mentioned rather than any other means; for that they being all Brick-makers in <hi>Egypt</hi> before, they kindled fire throughout their Habitations for the burning their tale of Bricks. But when works are
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152822:41"/> lawful and needful to be done on the Sabbath-day, ſuch as are works of piety, and works of preſerving the Life of Man, the neceſſary helps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as making fire is lawful alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The continued, and never blamed practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> of making fire on the Sabbath-day for theſe duties, proveth the ſame. They were never at any time blamed for making fire on the Sabbath for theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as far as we can read in Sacred Scripture. The man that was put to death for gathering wood (whether to faggot it, or to add it to his Pile or Heap, is not expreſſed) on the Sabbath day, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.32. doth make nothing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And that they did make fire on the Sabbath-days for theſe duties is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable. How elſe ſhould the meat-offerings baken in Ovens and in Pans, and in Frying-pans be made, which they were to bring to the Prieſts as oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.4, 5, 7. How elſe could the Shew-bread be Baked, which were conſtantly provided and ſet on the pure Table of the Lord every Sabbath-day? <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.5, 6, &amp;c. And how elſe ſhould the Paſchal Lamb be Roaſted, when the Feaſt of the Paſſover fell on the Sabbath-day? Every family was then to eat Roaſt-meat throughout their Habitations; and the remains to burnt in the fire, that nothing be left until the morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.10. Sure theſe things could not be done without making fire. In like manner did they make fire on the Sabbath for preſervation of their life and health. For doubtleſs the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> baken and ſod their Manna on their Sabbath-days, as they did on the other days of the week. Cold Manna, and unpound would not agree with many mens ſtomacks on the Sabbath, who on every of the other days did eat it hot, either Baked or Sodder. On every of the other ſix days they gathered every man according to his eating an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for every man, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.16, 18. And then ground it, or beat it in a Mortar, and baked it in Pans, and made Cakes of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.8. And in that week which was ſet for the meaſuring out to them their firſt Saturday-Sabbath, which was their ſeventh day from their firſt beginning of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Quails and Manna; <hi>Moſes</hi> on the ſixth day (that is, on the day before their new Sabbath appointed) ſaid unto them, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath ſaid, To morrow is the reſt of the Holy Sabbath unto the Lord; Bake that which you will Bake to day, and ſeethe that you will ſeethe; and that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning,</hi> Exod. 16.23, 24. On this ſixth day they gathered double to what they did before; whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> told them that the one part they ſhould Bake or Seethe at their pleaſure, but the remainder, that is, the other part, they were not willed either to Bake or to Seethe on that day, but to lay it up for the next day; the which they did: and although it was neither Baked nor Sodden, yet it ſtank not neither did worms appear therein. Now if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might not pound the ſaid Manna laid up for their Food, nor Bake, nor Boyl the ſame, and ſo e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t it hot, as on other days; the Sabbath-day which ſhould be a delight unto them, would breed them ſorrow, and be burthenſome unto them: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152822:42"/> than we ſhould read of their complaints hereof. We read how they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained for want of change, and wept when they remembred the Fleſh, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, Melons, Leeks, Onions, and Garlick which they had in <hi>Egypt: But now ſaid they, our ſoul is dried away, there is nothing beſide this Manna, &amp;c. Numb.</hi> 11.6. How would they have complained if on the Sabbath-days they ſhould have been driven to have eaten the Manna, not Pound, nor Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, nor Sod? Their ſilence herein argueth them not to have been driven to ſuch a ſtrait, but that they did either Bake or Boyl their Manna, and ſo eat it hot as they did on the other days; the which could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their making a fire.</p>
               <p>Or otherwiſe if by this precept the <hi>Jews</hi> were not to make any fire at all on their Sabbath-day, neither for the furtherance of their Services, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards God, nor for the preſervation of the health, and life of man; then I ſay that that precept was particularly given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly concerned that Nation and no other Common-Wealth whatſoever. And that this Commandment bound them not thereto, no more than it bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us or any other People whatſoever. This Law bound, and doth bind all men to make the ſeventh day with them a day of reſt, not only from works of ſlavery, commonly called <hi>ſervile works,</hi> from which the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound on their Feaſt of the Paſſover: <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Num.</hi> 28.18. and on certain other of their Feaſt-days. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.8, 21, 25, 35, 36. <hi>Num.</hi> 28.25, 26. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from all the works of mens Trade, Occupation, or Function whatſoever: Yea our thoughts, and minds are not to be upon them on the Lords day; as the one are called our works, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.12: ſo the other are called our thoughts.</p>
               <p>This Law bindeth all, that they ſhould not only make the ſeventh day to be a day of reſt, and ceſſation from all the works of our callings; but alſo that we Sanctifie that reſt. <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that thou Sanctifie the Sabbath-day:</hi> that is in <hi>Engliſh, the day of ceſſation, or reſt,</hi> for that <hi>is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord.</hi> We may well call it the Lords day, or the Lords Sabbath; for that it is a day holy to the Lord: we are not only to ceaſe from the works of our Profeſſions and Callings on that day; but are then to perform alſo, and do duties, and works of Holineſs unto the Lord. On the ſeventh day is a ceſſation to reſt, <hi>a Convocation of holineſs,</hi> Lev. 23.3. Or as it is in our Tranſlation; <hi>The ſeventh day is the Sabbath of reſt, and Holy Convocation:</hi> And in Exodus, <hi>In the ſeventh day is the reſt of ceſſation, Holineſs to the Lord, Exod.</hi> 31.15. And a little after that: <hi>In the ſeventh day ſhall be to you Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, a reſt of ceſſation unto the Lord,</hi> Exod. 35.2. All which do ſhew that on the Sabbath-day, which is the day following our ſix days of labour, we ſhould not only reſt from all our Functions, and works of our Profeſſions for getting of worldly Wealth and Maintenance, but we are to keep this reſt, ceſſation or Sabbath holy, to the Glory and Honour of the moſt great God our Creator, and Redeemer.</p>

               <p>And now I conclude this point with the expreſs words of the Homily for the time of Prayer. <hi>Thus it may plainly appear, that Gods Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was to have a ſolemn time and ſtanding day in the week, wherein the People ſhould come together, and have in remembrance his wonderful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and to render him thanks for them, as appertaineth to loving, kind, and Obedient People.</hi> And with that a little before. <hi>And therefore by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment we ought to have a time, as one day in the week, wherein we ought to reſt, yea from our lawful and needful works; for like as it appeareth by the Commandment, that no man in ſix days ought to be ſlothful or idle: but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to labour in that ſtate wherein God hath ſet him: Even ſo God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven expreſs charge to all men, that upon the Sabbath-day, which is now our Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, they ſhould ceaſe from all weekly and work-day labour, to the intent, that like as God himſelf wrought ſix days and reſted the ſeventh, and Bleſſed and Sanctified it, and Conſecrated it to quietneſs and reſt from labour: even ſo Gods Obedient People ſhould uſe the Sunday Holily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As concerning the particular duties to be done on the Sabbath-day, there being ſo many Learned and Godly men who have Written ſo fully of them; and are or may be in moſt mens Hands or Cloſets; I forbear to ſpeak of them here for brevities ſake, referring the Reader to their Plenty; and now in the next place will ſpeak of the ſecond part of this Commandment.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> The great care and proviſion had by the Lord, for mans keeping and Sanctifying the Sabbath day.</head>
               <p>THE former part of this fourth Commandment, which is, that we ſhould keep Holy the Sabbath-day, hath been at large handled before; now it reſteth, that I ſpeak ſomewhat of the ſecond part alſo; which I will do briefly in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>In this ſecond part is ſet out in many words the great care and proviſion had of the Lord, that men ſhould obſerve this Law, and keep holy the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day as God commandeth. And this proviſion of the Lord ſtandeth not in one, two or three only, but in many and weighty Inducements and reaſons, the leaſt of which ſhould have been ſufficient to inforce our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, had not our hearts been hardned, and we moſt rebellious, wilfully refuſing to yield Obedience unto the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral inducements and reaſons the Lord uſed to win us unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this Law are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Is the Caveat prefixed only to this, and to none other of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Remember, Remember the Sabbath day to Sanctifie it.</hi> This charge of heedfulneſs would mightily work upon an Obedient heart; he would every day of his ſix, be thinking how to do and diſpatch all his buſineſſes in thoſe days, that when the ſeventh day come, he may freely without any incumbrance, betake himſelf to the Worſhip and Service of his God; and when it cometh will be mindful of the day, and careful of obſerving and keeping the ſame Holy as his God Commandeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord hath here plainly pointed out unto man, what day is the Sabbath-day which he ſhould Sanctifie. The Lord hath affixed as it were an Index to this Law; that as the true hour of the day is known and pointed out by the Index or Finger in a Dial, whereby he that can but tell the number of the hour-lines, may eaſily know what hour of the day it is: ſo here, he that can but tell the days of the week, may eaſily tell what day is the Sabbath-day. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour and do all thy work, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath.</hi> The ſeventh day is the Sabbath, not the ſeventh day from thy Birth, nor the ſeventh day from the firſt beginning of the Creation, nor from any ſet <hi>Epoche:</hi> For then it would have put the moſt skilful Mathematicians to a ſtand, for the finding out
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152822:43"/> when this ſeventh day ſhould begin, but it is the day following the ſix days of labour. In what Countrey ſoever a man is, though he is not well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Language of that place, and doth not underſtand what the names of the week-days ſignifie; yet if he can tell which be their ſix work-days, he may then tell alſo which is their ſeventh day. It maketh not much by what names the days of the week be called, nor what the ſignification of either or any of the week-days ſhould be. The ſeventh day of the week with <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> hath been called by divers ſeveral names, and that even by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> themſelves, ſuch as theſe: <hi>Sunday: The Lords day: The firſt day of the Week:</hi> And in latter times it hath been called alſo the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day; but in the firſt times <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would not call it the Sabbath-day, becauſe all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> deteſted the name of Sabbath, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the name of Sunday, as before is ſhewed: Neither could they reliſh this name for a good while after their Converſion. It is not much matter by which of theſe names we call our ſeventh day; nor whether we underſtand the ſignification of the name; as what <hi>Sunday,</hi> or <hi>The Lords day,</hi> or <hi>The firſt day of the week</hi> do ſignifie, or why we do ſo call our ſeventh day. Though he do not know it to be called Sunday from our <hi>Heathen</hi> Anceſtors, who called this day ſo, in honour of the Sun, whom they Worſhipped: nor know it to be called the Lords day, becauſe it is his Sabbath who Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: nor know it to be called <hi>the firſt day of the week,</hi> for that the <hi>Jews</hi> called this day <hi>the firſt of the Sabbath,</hi> and ſo was called by them in Sacred Scripture; and for that the latter Tranſlators of the Bible, would have this name by which the <hi>Jews</hi> called it, to be in our Tongue, called <hi>the firſt day of the week;</hi> So as that now we count it not the day of the Sun, as our <hi>Heathen</hi> Anceſtors did: nor count it to be the firſt of our work-days, or firſt in order and tale of our week-days as the <hi>Jews</hi> did. The name of the day doth neither add or alter any thing of the nature thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here is ſet down the equity of this Law. It is ſo reaſonable that none need complain. The Lord alloweth man ſix days, and reſerveth but one for himſelf. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour and do all that thou haſt to do, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath</hi> How unreaſonable are ſuch who are not contented with the Lord's liberal allowance, but incroach on the Lords day alſo, which he reſerved for his own honour and worſhip?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In that the Lord did in many words ſet down ſo punctually. 1. The works from which men are reſtrained. 2. The perſons who are reſtrained.</p>
               <p>The works forbidden are all kind of Trades, Profeſſions and Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which on other days men do or may uſe for getting their living and maintenance. There is no word in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which doth ſo fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152822:44"/> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which here the Lord forbiddeth to be done, as doth Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Art or Occupation, as I ſhewed before, ſo that none can excuſe himſelf, ſaying, that his Profeſſion requireth little or no labour of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as do Husbandry and divers other Handicrafts: for God forbids <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> all Vocations, Functions or Occupations. Men ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all their works, of what Profeſſion or Vocation ſoever they be. Yea theſe works are not only forbidden in reſpect of the labour of the hand, but of the Tongue and mind alſo; we ſhould not be talking of them, neither ſhould our hearts and minds run on them on the Lords day.</p>
               <p>As God for the furtherance of Mans true Obedience to this Law, hath fully ſhewed the works we are forbidden to do, ſo doth he alſo as fully, and in many words ſhew who are forbidden to do any of theſe works; <hi>Thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, nor, &amp;c.</hi> Whoſoever hath any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and command over himſelf, muſt not only be careful that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abſtain from his labours, but alſo if he hath authority and command over others, as Son, Daughter, Man, or Maid, Ox, or Aſs, he is to ſee that they alſo ceaſe from all work-day labours on the ſeventh day; he is not to imploy any of them: He nor any of his may imploy either Ox or Aſs, nor lend or let them to hire for their labour on the ſeventh day, or on any part of that day. The Lords expreſſions are large herein, that ſo all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and excuſes may be taken away.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Lord ſheweth here, and would have us to know that we have no right unto the ſeventh day, nor to any part thereof, for doing of our own works thereon, for the ſeventh day is the Lords day, and not ours, it is <hi>The Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> (as it is in this place in our Bibles ſo Tranſlated,) it is, ſaith God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Sabbath to the Lord: that is, a Reſt or Ceſſation to the Lord, as before I have ſhewed. <hi>See chap.</hi> 8. It is a day Holy to the Lord, and therefore none other than the Lords. All the Tithe of the Land, whether the ſeed of the Land, or of the Fruit of the Tree, (in the time of the Law) was the Lords, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.30. and ſo was the Tithe of the Herd or of the Flock, even of whatſoever paſſed under the rod, <hi>verſe</hi> 32. for the Tithe of all theſe were Holy to the Lord, <hi>verſe</hi> 30, 32. and therefore they were the Lords; they were his Seed, his Fruit, his Lambs, &amp;c. One Lamb was no more Holy than another when they fell from their Damms; and before they were Tithed out, the Poſſeſſor of them might have mingled them at his pleaſure; he was not tied to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his Tithing at one Lamb rather than at another; but from what Lamb ſoever he began, every tenth Lamb that in order paſſed under the Rod was the Lords: he might not then change it, nor ſearch whether it was good or bad; <hi>verſe</hi> 33. it was then Holy to the Lord, it was the Lords
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152822:44"/> Lamb; and of ſuch as detained the tenth, the Lord complained that they had robbed him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8, 9. And ſo I ſay, concerning the ſeventh day in the like ſenſe, that one day of it ſelf is no more Holy than is another. <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were not tied by any Divine Law to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their week, or ſevening from any ſet particular time: but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their accuſtomed week, and ſo beginning their ſevening from the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, the ſeventh from thence in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly courſe is Sacred to the Lord, it is the Lord's day; no man upon his particular occaſions may change the ſame: he may not ſay, My buſineſs is ſuch that I cannot keep this Sabbath-day, but I will keep another day in the week which will be as good. He doth deceive himſelf herein, he may not put off the ſeventh to another day, but ſhould defer his buſineſs rather. When men take the ſeventh day which is Sacred to the Lord, and imploy the ſame about their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, either in whole or in part, they may as truly be ſaid to Rob the Lord, as they under the Law were ſaid ſo to do in not paying their due Tithes and offerings, <hi>Mal,</hi> 3.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Lord was pleaſed to ſet out unto us the ground of this Law; why he would have a day in a week appointed for his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, rather than a week in every month, or a month in every year: And why he would have the ſeventh day for his Service rather than the tenth; the ground hereof the Lord here ſheweth to be this; <hi>In ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that in them is; and reſted the ſeventh day.</hi> The ſame ground for the Sanctification of the ſeventh day is alſo declared before in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Lord declareth, and he would have his People hereby to know that he hath Annexed a Bleſſing unto this day: <hi>God Bleſſed the ſeventh day.</hi> They who wait on the Lord, and Serve him ſincerely, during this their day of attendance, ſhall find the Lord a bountiful rewarder: their ceaſing from labour for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſervice, ſhall be for their profit, they ſhall be gainers thereby.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If there had been none other reaſon or motive to ſtir us up unto Obedience in a careful keeping of the ſeventh day unto the Honour of Good, yet this alone which the Lord hath given in the Cloſe of this Commandment ſhould ſuffice; <hi>The Lord hath Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it:</hi> God hath Inſtituted it. But when the Lord hath given us ſuch a ſpecial Charge of remembring the Sabbath-day to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it, and hath ſo plainly pointed out unto us what the day is which he will have us to Sanctifie, that none may plead Ignorance
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152822:45"/> about the time, and how many words the Lord uſed in prohibiting all works, and in the enumeration of all degrees prohibited: laying down alſo the equity hereof, and his own example together, with his Bleſſing it and his Soveraign Inſtitution hereof: how can any without palpable Ignorance, or wilful Rebellion plead Ignorance of the Sabbath? or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, not yield ready Obedience thereto?</p>
